Il. ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING SOFTWARE/SYSTEM USED BY
L&T:

13. L&T uses Enterprise Resource Planning ("ERP") software/ system.
The ERP system is a centralised system for recording the
expenditure incurred in respect of inter alia all departments,

processes, operations of each project of L&T in electronic form.

14. The Information and Technology department of L&T customised the
a ERP software and developed the version called Enterprise

ZAnformation Portal (“EIP”) which is being used by construction

that all expenses are relatable and easily identifiable to such projects,
a unique job code is generated in the EIP system for each project
under which all expenses incurred towards or related to the said

project are booked under various accountin:

AC } 5


rs)
16. Based on my personal knowledge of use of EIP, I have hereinbelow
explained the entire process of booking expenses in EIP as well as its

working for CIP 1 & 2.

IJ. WORKING OF EIP

17. EIP comprises of numerous modules such as Asset Management
System, Supply Chain Management, Work Order Management,
Finance module, Human Resource Management, Logistic
Management, Workforce Management, Travel & Admin module,
etc. As Head, Finance and Accounts, I have access to the Finance
Module of EIP, which contains amongst others, Sub-contractor
Journal Voucher, Purchase Journal Vouchers, Bank Payment

Voucher, Cash Payment Voucher, etc. required for booking of

expenses.

18. For making an entry of a transaction in the EIP, the authorised staff
is first provided with hard copies of the relevant invoices and other
supporting documents of the concerned team. Thereafter, an entry of

a transaction in the EIP system is initiated by the authorised staff of

_—— the Finance & Accounting team by entering the requisite details in

ra ve O 2 the EIP system. The name of the said ee staff appears below
) “,

19. Thereafter, the technical in-charge of the relevant Package is
required to certify if the said expense has been incurred. For the said
purpose, the creator of the entry provides a Page of the system

res thereon along
‘


20.

with hard copies of the relevant invoices and other supporting
documents to the Technical In-charge (ie. concerned Project
Manager). ‘The Project Manager authorises an entry after verifying
the entry with hard copies of the relevant invoices and other
supporting documents. Upon approval by the Project Manager, he
signs above the “Passed By” appearing on the printout of the system
generated extract. The Project Manager accordingly updates the EIP

to reflect his approval of the entry in the system.

Pursuant to the aforesaid first level approval, there is a second level

‘of approval which is by the Finance and Accounts In-charge of the

concerned Package. For the said purpose, the Finance and Accounts
In-charge is also provided with the printout of the system generated
extract (now signed by the Creator and the Project Manager) along
with hard copies of the relevant invoices and other supporting
documents. The Finance and Accounts In-charge of the concerned
Package authorises the entry after verifying the entry with hard
copies of the relevant invoices and other supporting documents. The

Finance and Accounts in-charge of the relevant package verifies the

entry and authorises the payment, whose name thereafter appears

Post both the level of approvals, the “cashier” collects the signed
hard copy of the system generated extract and makes payment,

either through cash or bank payment.


22. The signed hard copies of the system generated extracts are stored
and maintained at Jaipur and are available for inspection, in case

required.

23. Post the voucher having been authorised and payment being
disbursed, EJP generates a new voucher number (the hand-written
voucher numbers posted on the hard copies of the system extracts
along with the date of payment). Hence, if system extract is
generated post authorisation of payment, it is the new voucher
number (corresponding with the hand-written voucher number on
the hard copy) along with the date of payment which reflects in the
EIP instead of the earlier voucher number generated as on the

creation date along with date of creation.

24. I have annexed herewith and exhibited as Exhibit CW-2/3 a flow
chart explaining the booking of expenses in EIP. Printout of system
generated extract of an entry made in EIP as on 22 May 2023 is
annexed herewith and exhibited as Exhibit CW-2/4. Copies of 2
entries made in EIP bearing signatures of the concerned persons,

record keeping through the EIP in the course of execution of its
projects. The EIP used by L&T has all checks, balances and controls
in place for the accounting entries made by it. Copy of certificate

IV. Working of EIP- CTP 1&2:

28.

Since EIP is the centralised system of operations for L&T
construction, I have used EIP as part of my duties/job profile in all
my postings. Further, being part of Finance & Accounts team at HQ-
Mumbai, I was co-ordinating and consolidating financial accounts of
all projects under Transportation Infrastructure division of L&T
including CIP 1 & 2 being recorded and maintained in the EIP as

well as facilitating audit by the statutory auditors.

29. Further, when | was working as Manager (Accounts) at HQ-

Mumbai, one of my responsibilities in the said role was creation of

unique job code for every new project in EIP.

30. I created the 2 (two) parent job codes for CIP 1 & 2 namely -

LE130759 and LE131222 in October 2013. The parent job code
LE131222 is in respect of Minor Structures and Track works in CTP 1
& 2 and parent job code LE130759 is in respect of all other works

excluding Minor Structure and Track Works.

31. Further to creating parent job code, I also created 8 (eight) sub-job

codes (“child job codes”) for CIP 1&2. For the work under MS-3
from Bhagega to Iqbalgarh, a list of relevant job codes and
accounting codes has been annexed at page 32380-32381 in Volume

CD- 65 and exhibited as Exhibit C-63.

Accounts team for each of the Packages. In all, a total of about 35-40

people work in the said 4 teams. All four teams report to me.

expenses related to execution of the aforesaid work are booked in
electronic form under the aforesaid child job codes. All these job

17

44, I have set out few explanations in respect of claims/ payments

made:

(a)

(d)

The payments related to all vendors engaged for project are
being made centrally by Shared Service Center, Chennai for’
L&T, on daily basis by Bulk NEFT mode.

Salaries and wages of the employees are paid by corporate

Shared Service Center, Mumbai. The total salary payable for the

all employees engaged for this project is debited. This will

appear as a single entry in the ledger and hence, cannot be

bifurcated employee wise. L&T bank statement will have

entries for debit for whole salaried group and not individual

employee wise or project wise as proof of payment.

From the bulk payments made, I have identified the payments

for CTP 1&2 using the payments details in the ledger. I state

that the ledger is on ‘an accrual basis'. Some elements of salary

included in payslip (i.e., performance linked reward etc.) are

payments for all construction projects of all the independent
companies of L&I Construction are made through SSC Bank
Accounts. All these accounts’ (ICs and SSC) balances are auto sweep
to LTC-DC disbursement accounts. All such auto sweeps from all
other divisions’ accounts and also SSC Corporate Accounts in
Mumbai (operated for all staff members’ payments like salaries,
benefits, PE, retirement benefits, travel expenses and all other staff
related expenses across all the staff members or all the divisions of
L&T) will be accumulated in L&T House (LTH) Corporate Treasury

Account at the end of each day.

54. This balance of LTH Corporate Treasury Accounts is funded, on a
daily basis, by many bankers like SBI, HDFC, Citi, ICICI, Axis and
consortium of various banks, etc. depending upon funding status,
interest rate agreements between L&T and Bankers and the short-
term and long-term borrowings as well as investments (in case of

accounts which are funded through corporate treasury of LTH as
per the process explained above. Since the outflow for the CTP1&2
project could not met from the progress payments received under
the interim payment certificate (IPC), the gap in the cashflow had
been funded through arrangement of fund through corporate
treasury of L&T and for that L&T had incurred unforeseen interest

cost during the extended period.
97. Being such a large engincering and corporate conglomerate of India,
L&T does not take funding separately for each construction projects.
Hence, there are no evidence of borrowings available independently
for CTP1&2 projects’ cash gap funding, which is actually funded by

corporate treasury of L&T through arrangements of funding from

various bankers and interest cost is incurred by L&T at central level.

58. L&T’s central treasury which had funded the project's additional
overheads/cash gap during extended period has incurred additional
interest for arranging funds as per the Interest Rate Certificate dated
