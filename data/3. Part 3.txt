distance of about 5 to 15 m beyond the drilling limits, or to the end of the
excavation, as decided by Engineer shall be removed before drilling the presplitting
holes. Particular care and attention shall be directed to the beginning and end of
excavations to ensure complete removal of all overburden soil and weathered rock
and to expose fresh rock to an elevation equal to the bottom of the adjacent lift of
the presplitting holes being drilled.

Slope holes for presplitting shall be drilled along the line of the planned slope within
the specified tolerances. The drill holes shall be not less than 60 mm nor more than
75 mm in diameter. Drilling operations shall be controlled by the use of proper
equipment and technique to ensure that no hole shail deviate from the plane of the
planned slope by more than 300 mm nor shall any hole deviate from being parallel
to an adjacent hole by more than two -third of the planned horizontal spacing
between holes.

The length of presplit holes for any individual lift shall not exceed 9 m. The spacing
of presplit holes shall not exceed 900 mm on centers and shall be adjusted to
result in a uniform shear face between holes.

Auxiliary drill holes along the presplit line, not loaded or stemmed, may be ordered
by the Engineer. Except for spacing, auxiliary drill holes shall conform to the
provisions for presplit holes.

The line of production holes shall be placed inside the presplit lines in such a
manner as to avoid damage to the presplit face.

If necessary, to reduce shatter and overbreak of the presplit surface, the first line of
the production holes shall be drilled parallel to the slope line at the top of the cut
and at each bench level thereafter.

Any blasting technique, which results in damage to the presplit surface, shall be
immediately discontinued. No portion of any production hole shall be drilled within
2.5 m of a presplit plane except as approved by the Engineer. The bottom of the
production holes shall not be lower than the bottom of the presplit holes.

A maximum offset of 600 mm will be permitted for a construction working bench at
the bottom of each lift for use in drilling the next lower presplitting pattern. The
drilling operations shall be adjusted to compensate for drift of previous levels and
for the offset at the start of new levels to maintain the specified slope plane.

The maximum diameter of explosives used in presplit holes shall not be greater
than one -half the diameter of the presplit hole.

Only standard cartridge explosives prepared and packaged by explosive
manufacturing firms shall be used in presplit holes. These shall be fired as
recommended by the manufacturer. Ammonium nitrate composition blasting agents
will not be permitted in presplit ting operations.

Stemming may be required to achieve a satisfactory presplit face. Stemming
material shall be dry free-running material all of which passes 11.2 mm sieve and
90 per cent of which is retained on 2.80 mm sieve. Stemmed presplit holes shall be
completely filled to the collar. All charges in each presplitting pattern shall be
detonated simultaneously.

The presplit face shall not deviate more than 300 mm from the plane passing
through adjacent drill holes, except where the character of the rock is such that, as
determined by the Engineer, irregularities are unavoidable. When completed, the
average plane of the slopes shall conform to the slopes indicated on the plans and
no point on the completed slopes shall vary from the limit as specified in
‘Tolerances and Acceptance Criteria’ of Section 5.9: Embankment of these
Specifications. In no case shall any portion of the slope encroach on the side
drains.

As long as equally satisfactory presplit slopes are obtained, then either the slope
face may be presplit before drilling for production blasting or presplitting the slope
face and production blasting may be done at the same time, provided that the
presplitting drill holes are fired with zero delay and the production holes are
delayed starting at the row of holes farthest from the slope and progressing in
steps to the row of holes nearest the presplit line, which row shall be delayed at
least 50 milliseconds. In either case the prespliting holes shall extend either to the
end of the excavation or for a distance of not less than 15 m beyond the limits of
the production holes to be detonated.

(3) Gradation size analysis and percentage of fines analysis of blanket material should be
determined using wet sieve analysis as per procedure of IS 2720 (Part IV) — 1985 and
particle size distribution curve should be plotted, so as to assess its suitability. It would be
necessary to carry out wet analysis to assess actual percentage of fines. To expedite the
work, dry sieve analysis may be carried out if variations between the results of dry and
wet analysis are not significant and adequate margin exist with respect to acceptance
criteria. However in such cases also the wet analysis has to be carried out at frequent
intervals to verify the extent of variations. In any situation, the acceptance of blanket
material would be based on wet analysis only.

(4) Selection of Blanket Material -

(i)

(ii)

(iii)

(iv)

(v)

Proper survey of area close to Embankment site, at different locations needs to be
carried out to identify suitable sources for blanket material required. Aim of such
source identification survey is to use naturally available material, which is cheap and
conforms to the specifications laid down.

If, naturally available materials do not meet the desired specifications, blanket
material can be produced by mechanical process from crushing or blending method
or combination of these two methods. However detailed methodology of blending to
be adopted to produce large quantity of blanket material with consistent quality,
shall have to be laid down. Trials (theoretical and laboratory) for blending to judge
the final product shall have to be carried out & shall be subject to consent of the
Engineer. Naturally available sand, quarry dust or crusher run, if available, can be
used as prepared subgrade also.

Quarry dust or material specifically manufactured through crushers using boulders,
rocks, etc. as raw material, conforming to the blanket material specification may also
be used as blanketing material.

Note: For production of blanket material by mechanical means as elaborated above,
reference will be made to RDSO specification no. GE: IRS-2 (final) (Specification for
Mechanically Produced Blanketing Material for Railway Formation including
Guidelines for Laying).

In rare cases, where after studies/trials & survey, blanket material has minor
variation from the laid down specifications, experts guidance should be sought and
applied by the Contractor under the instructions of the Engineer after giving details
of trials/studies conducted along with justification and details of soil used for sub
grade over which blanket is proposed to be laid.

In any case, before planning for use of any material for formation of blanket,
Engineer's specific approval is to be taken for the use of that particular material and
also for the location from where such material will be quarried / sourced

Ground Improvement

Field tests are required to be conducted on sub-soil strata, such as Plate Load Test for
determination of Elastic Modulus at second loading (Ey2), Standard Penetration Test to

determine

N-value and Unconfined Compression Test or Vane Shear Test to determine

Unconfined Compressive Strength or Undrained Cohesion Cu. If values of these test
parameters as specified hereunder are not achieved, then ground improvement is required

In case the black cotton soil is encountered by the Contractor during the course of
geotechnical investigations, the following remedies are suggested :

(a) Treating top layer of the soil with quick lime so as to reduce the harmful effects of
the black cotton soil

(b) Providing a blanket of graded inverted filter at top of the Embankment
(c) Consolidation of black cotton soil at optimum moisture content

(d) Provision of bituminous carpet or similar other intercepting material like polythene
sheets etc. so as to intercept the surface water getting in to formation

(e) To provide the drainage conditions of the formation at surface and sub-surface level

Design of Side Slope of Embankment

(1)

(2)

(3)

Co)

Usually side slope gradient of 2H:1V for the Embankment and 1H:1V for Formation in Cut
should be sufficient, however the same shall be designed by the Contractor based on the
slope stability analysis to be carried by the Contractor.

Slope stability analysis should be carried out to design stable slopes for the embankment
and has to be carried out in detail for any height of embankment in following situations:

(i) When subsoil is soft, compressible & marshy type for any depth.

(ii) When subgrade soil (fill material) has very low value of cohesion ' C' ' such that
C'/yH (where H is height of embankment and y is bulk density of soil) is negligible,
i.e., in range of 0.01 or so.

(iii) When highest water table is within 1.5xH (H is the height of embankment), below
ground level, then submerged unit weight of soil below water level should be taken.

In cutting slope, softening of soil occurs with the passage of time, and therefore, long
term stability is the most critical, and should be taken into consideration while designing
the cuttings.

Detailed slope stability analysis should be carried out as per procedure laid down in

‘Annexure-lil’ of “Guidelines for Earthwork in Railway Projects, Guideline No. GE: G—1”.

This procedure would be applicable for most of the cases. However, in certain situations,

i)

further detailed analysis may be required due to the site conditions and shall be carried
out by an expert consultant.

Slope stability analysis may also be carried out using standard computer
programme/software especially made for this purpose. However, the efficacy of the
software used should have approval / clearance of RDSO.

5.9.6 Execution

(1)

(2)

Field Trials

(i) Field trial for compaction on a test section shall be conducted on fill material to
assess the optimum thickness of layer and optimum number of passes for the type
of roller planned to be used to arrive at desired density. Procedure for field
compaction trials as given in Annexure — IV of ‘Guidelines for Earthwork in Railway
Projects - July 2003, Report No. GE: G-1" issued by RDSO may be referred for
guidance.

(ii) If the soil has less than required moisture content, necessary amount of water shall
be added to it either in borrow pits or after the soil has been spread loosely on the
embankment. Addition of water may be done through flooding or irrigating the
borrow areas or sprinkling the water on the embankment through a truck mounted
water tank sprinkling system. Use of hose pipe for water need to be avoided.

(iii) If the soil is too wet, it shall be allowed to dry till the moisture content reaches to
acceptable level required for the compaction.

(iv) Placement moisture content of soil should be decided based on the field trial and
site conditions. The objective should be to compact near OMC to achieve uniform
compaction with specified density in most efficient manner

Preparation of foundation for embankment

(i) Prior to placing any embankment upon any area, all clearing and grubbing
operations shall be completed in accordance with Clause 5.6: Clearing and
Grubbing of these Specifications.

(ii) Natural ground / sub-soil Strata shall be prepared to receive the placement of first
layer of the Embankment.

(iii) In case where the embankments are to be constructed on ground having slopes or
along the existing embankments of Indian Railways requiring widening,

a) All vegetation shall be uprooted and taken away from the site of work. The
loose material removed from the slope should be dumped to form the bottom
most layer on the ground in width to be widened. If required, it shall be
supplemented with granular soil

b) Starting from toe, the benching on the slopes at every 300mm height shall be
provided on slope surface so as to provide proper amalgamation between the
old and new earthwork. the slope of the benching shall be 4:1

c) Material which has been loosened shall be re-compacted simultaneously with
the first level of embankment material placed. It should be ensured that there
is no humus material left on the benched slope.

d) Care shall be taken to avoid entry of rain water in to the formation from this
weak junction which otherwise would result in development of weak formation,
slope failure & unevenness settlement

(iv) In case of the Embankment in swamps or water the Contractor shall excavate or
displace swamp ground / water and backfill with suitable material. Backfill will be in

During construction of embankment, a smooth grade having an adequate crown or
super-elevation shall be maintained to provide drainage. Embankment shall be
constructed to the required grade, and completed embankment shall correspond to
the shape of the typical sections shown on the Drawings.

Earth Embankment

Earth embankment shall be defined as those principally of material other than rock,
and shall be constructed of consented material from designated or other consented
sources. Earth embankment shall be constructed in successive layers, for the full
width of the cross-section and in such lengths as are suited to the compaction and
watering methods used

equipment used in compacting, the adjoining section of embankment shall be
compacted in the manner prescribed under the Section 5.8: Excavation and Backfill
for Structures. Embankment placed round spill through type abutments shall be
compacted such a manner as to maintain approximately the same elevation on each
side of the abutment and each layer of material shall be mixed, wetted and
compacted as specified herein

(iv) Preparation of Subgrade

a) The surface of the finished subgrade shall be neat and workmanlike and shall
have the required form, super elevation, levels, grades, and cross-section.
The surface shall be constructed to the specified accuracy to permit the
construction of subsequent layers of material to the thickness, surface
tolerance, and compaction as specified.

b) As far as is practicable and when directed by the Engineer, the Contractor
shall construct the Embankment fills as early in the Contract period as
possible to allow for consolidation of the embankment during the remainder of
the Contract period.

c) Clods or hard lumps of soil of borrow area shall be broken to 75 mm or lesser
size before placing on embankment

d) Suitable thickness of soil of each layer is necessary to achieve uniform
compaction. Layer thickness depends upon type of soil involved and type of
roller, its weight and contact pressure of its drums. Normally, 200 mm to 300
mm layer thickness is optimum in the field for achieving homogenous
compaction. However for determination of optimum number of passes for a

particular type of roller and optimum thickness of layer at a predetermined
moisture content, a field trial for compaction is necessary as per IS: 10379 —
1982 and Heavy Compaction Test as per IS; 2720 However as a good
practice, thickness of layer should be generally kept as 300mm for fill material
and 250mm for blanket material in loose state before compaction.

e) Where streams or ditches are to be diverted, or abandoned, their beds should
be filled up to a level as consented by the Engineer. Within the limits of
earthwork, such fill shall be placed and compacted to the requirements as
specified in this Section. Filling shall be performed well ahead of the
construction of the embankments, and all other works involved such as
pumping, damming, etc. Embankment fill placed against the sides of pipe
culverts shall be placed in such manner as to maintain the same elevation on
both sides of the culvert.

f) The Engineer may request the installation of settlement plates, piezometers,
lateral movement stakes, inclinometers or other settlement control devices as
required by the Engineer for monitoring purpose.

g) In case of rainfall during construction of formation, care should be taken that
rain cuts are not allowed to develop wide and deep. The such rain cuts should
be attended to / repaired as a regular measure.

h) All settlement occurring in embankment construction shall be corrected by the
Contractor by providing additional layers of embankment or selected material.
The Contractor shall be fully responsible for the stability and integrity of the
embankment during the Contract and Maintenance periods.

i) If a soil failure either occurs or becomes imminent during the construction of
the embankment, the Engineer shall have the authority to suspend all
embankment construction in the affected area until corrective measures can
be determined and implemented. Any delay in the embankment construction
schedule and any other effects caused by implementation of the above clause
shall not constitute grounds on the part of the Contractor for a claim for
extension of the Contract and/or financial compensation.

(4) Use of Mixed Types of Soils

1)

(ii)

(iii)

Different types of fill materials, if used, should be deposited in such a way that parts
of the site receive roughly equal amount of a given material in roughly the same
sequence to get approximate homogeneous character of sub-grade

in situation where soils for construction of embankment consist of cobbles, boulders,
rock or waste fragments etc., largest size of material should normally not be greater
than 2/3rd of the loose layer thickness. However it should be ensured that after
every one to three meter of such construction, a 300 mm layer of properly
compacted soil be provided. A detailed slope stability analysis also need to be
carried out to ensure stability of such embankments.

In case cobbles, boulders etc. rock materials of bigger size than 2/3rd of the loose
layer thickness are only in small quantity, these may be placed on toe of the
embankment instead of using as sub-grade material.

(5) Compaction of embankment

0)

Embankments shall be constructed in layers of uniform thickness as specified. The
spreading of material in layers of desired thickness over the entire width of
embankment should be done by mechanical means and finished by a motor grader.

(iv) If natural moisture content (NMC) of the soil is less than the OMC, calculated

(Vv

—

amount of water based on the difference between OMC and NMC and quantity of
earthwork being done at a time, should be added with sprinkler attached to water
tanker and mixed with soil by motor grader or by other means for obtaining uniform
moisture content. When soil is too wet, it is required to be dried by aeration to
reduce the moisture content near to OMC. The embankment fill material shall have
the moisture contents close to the Optimum Moisture Contents (as determined by
Heavy Compaction Test IS: 2720 - Part 8) and in the range which can lead to
achieving the required dry density as specified below.

The rate of progress should be uniform so that the work is compacted to the final

(ix) Each layer of the Blanket Material fill shall be compacted to a dry density equal to at

(x)

least 100 % of the maximum dry density of the material as determined by Heavy
Compaction Test as per IS: 2720 (Part — 8) - 1983, with CBR values as specified
above in this section of these Specifications

Each layer of material shall be compacted uniformly by use of adequate and
appropriate compaction equipment as consented by the Employer after field trials
for compaction. The compaction shall be done in a longitudinal direction along the
embankment. The rolling for compaction of the fill material should commence from
edges towards centre with minimum overlap of 200mm between each run of the
roller. In final pass, roller should simply move over the surface without vibration so
that top surface is properly finished. .

(xi) At the end of the working day, fill material should not be left uncompacted. Care

should be taken during rolling to provide suitable slope on top of the bank to
facilitate quick shedding of water and avoid ponding on formation

(xii) Care shall be taken that the rain cuts are not allowed to be developed wide and

deep, otherwise these locations will remain weak spots. Contractor should attend /
repair such rain cuts as a regular measure

(xiii) Top of the formation should be finished to cross slope of 1 in 30 from one end to

other towards cess / drain in multiple lines and from centre of the formation to both
sides in single line.

should be avoided on the surface, as this will cause development of unevenness &
ruts on the surface which shall accumulate water and weaken the formation. The
Contractor shall maintain the subgrade by watering and rolling as frequently as
necessary to preserve the subgrade in a completely satisfactory condition as
specified above.

(xvi) Embankments shall be maintained to the grade and cross-section shown on the
Drawings throughout the contract period.

(xvii) Attention is drawn to the fact that the general compaction requirements shall at any
level apply to the full width of the embankment. Slopes to be covered with topsoil
and grassing shall have a firm surface before topsoil is placed.

(xviii) At places where embankment materials are not conducive to plant growth, top soil
obtained from site clearance as well as top layer of borrow area, which is rich in
organic content and suitable for plant growth, may be stored for covering slopes of
embankment & cutting after construction or other disturbed areas where re-
vegetation is required.

(6) Preparation of subgrade surface

The subgrade shall be shaped to correct line and level and the Contractor shall at all
times ensure that the subgrade is well drained and protected against damage from public
as well as construction traffic. The finished subgrade surface shall at no point deviate
more than the limits specified in para 5.9.10 “Tolerances and Acceptance Criteria” of
these Specifications. The surface shall be maintained in this state, with a regular light
sprinkling of water to prevent a dusty condition until the Blanket Layer are spread.

Slope Protection / Erosion Control: Suitable and cost effective slope protection / erosion
control system (Vegetation based) considering soil matrix, topography and hydrological
conditions to protect the side slopes of Embankment / Formation in Cutting should be provided
with the consent of Engineer. System shall consist of supplying & laying a layer of fertile top soil
having capability to support vegetation on the exposed slopes. Vegetation may be done in
accordance with any of methods as described in Clause 4.2, 4.3 & 4.5 of “Guidelines on
Erosion Control and drainage of Railway Formation (Guideline No. GE: G-4)” as issued by
RDSO.

Drainage Arrangement: Suitable drainage arrangement shall be provided for Embankment /
Formation in Cutting, Berms and particularly the drainage between DFC embankment and
existing Railway Embankment. Purpose of the drainage system is to collect water before it
reaches the problem areas, diverting the surface water away from formation / slope and reduce
infiltration of water. In case of formation in cutting and the DFC alignment near existing Railway
Embankment, suitable side drains, catch water drains may have to be provided. Cross slopes
should be 1:30.

When height of the bank is such that the blanket layers goes below normal ground level, side
drains may be required along the track at suitable distance so that the track alignment does not
become the channel for flow of ground surface water. In case of cuttings, properly designed
side drains of required water carrying capacity are to be provided. As Blanket Layer is to be
placed like fill / embankment, top of side drains has to remain below the bottom of the blanket
material.

In case of high Embankments with Berm, the suitably designed drain by the side of the berm
should be provided running parallel to the embankment and leading to the sloping drains which
are to be provided at suitable intervals along the slopes of the embankment. Sloping drains
should lead to the natural ground sufficiently away from toe of the embankment.

In case of double line construction, central drain between tracks should be avoided.

51





Dedicated Freight Corridor Project (Western Corridor Phase-1) Bid Documents — Volume III
Combined Package CT P-1 and CT P-2 Civil, Building and Track Work

5.9.9

If height of the cutting is less (say up to 4m) only side drains on both sides of the track are to be
provided. In case of deep cuttings, catch water drains of adequate water carrying capacity are
also provided.

Surface water flowing from top of hill slope towards the track is controlled by provision of catch
water drains, running parallel up to a point where the water can be safely discharged off. In
some of the situations, depending on topography of top of cutting, there may be requirement of
construction of net of small catch water drains which are subsequently connected to main catch
water drain. Catch water drain should be made pucca / lined with impervious flexible material
locally available.

Catch water drains should be located slightly away from top edge of cutting and water flow
should be led into nearby culvert or natural low ground. Catch water drains should have
adequate slope to ensure development of self cleansing velocity and should not have any weep
holes. It should have well designed outfall with protection against tail end erosion.

Depending upon the site conditions, water from the catch water drains may require to be
diverted by sloping drains and carrying across the track by means of culvert.

All the drains in general should lead to the nearest culvert or natural low ground longitudinally
or natural outlets existing near by where the water can be sufficiently discharged with
appropriately designed outfall arrangements duly consented by the Engineer.

Reference may be made to “Guidelines on Erosion Control and drainage of Railway Formation
(Guideline No. GE: G-4)” as issued by RDSO in this regard.

Quality Assurance

checks at all stages of construction viz. selection of construction materials, adoption of
method, use of suitable machinery for construction and during execution of work shall be
carried out

(2) Quality Check on Earthwork : Quality of execution of formation earthwork shall be
controlled through exercise of checks on the borrow material, blanket material
compaction process, drainage system, longitudinal & cross sectional profiles of the
embankment.

(i) Tests for Selection of Soil :

conducted on material. CBR is conducted on ground soil, embankment fill,
prepared sub-grade & blanket material to ensure the minimum specified CBR
value of these material to be used in construction. This test is carried out on
soil sample in laboratory as per procedure given in IS: 2720 (Part 16) — 1987
and in field as per |S: 2720 (part 31) — 1969.

per cent respectively.

Method of sampling and testing of materials shall be as required by the “Hand Book of Quality
Control for Construction of Roads and Runways’ (IRC: SP: 11) and these Specifications

Construction

Granular Sub-base shall not be placed, spread or compacted while the rain is falling, and no
compaction shall be carried out when the moisture content of the material fall outside the
specification range. In lacations where subbase materials are to be placed on a prepared sub-
grade, the sub-grade shall be prepared in accordance with Clause 5 of these Specifications
prior to subbase placement.

(1) ‘Trial sections

(i) Before Granular Sub-base construction is started, the Contractor shall spread and
compact trial sections. The purpose of the trial sections is to check the suitability of
the materials and suitability & efficiency of the equipment and construction method
which is proposed to be used by the Contractor. Therefore, the Contractor must use
the same materials, equipment and procedures he proposes to use for the main
work. One trial section about 50m shall be made for every type of material and/or
construction equipment/procedure proposed for use.

(ii) Density tests and other tests required as per IS: 2720- 1983 (Part 8)

(iii) lf Engineer considers materials not to be suitable for sub-base as appropriate to the
trial, the material shall be removed at the Contractor's expense, and a new trial
section shall be constructed.

(iv) If the basic conditions regarding the type of material or procedure change during the
execution of the work, new trial sections shall be constructed.

(2) Mixing & Spreading
The mixing of the sub-base material shall be done mechanically by mix-in-place method
using rotavator or other approved equipment capable of mixing the material to the

required degree. Manual mixing shall not be done except with the specific prior approval
of Engineer.

Moisture contents of the loose material shall be checked in accordance with IS: 2720
(Part 2) and suitably adjusted so that at the time of compaction it is from 1% above to
2% below the optimum moisture content corresponding to IS: 2720 (Part 8). While
adding water, due allowance shall be made for evaporation losses.

Immediately prior to the laying of sub-base, the subgrade already finished shall be
prepared by removing all vegetation and other extraneous matter, lightly sprinkled with
water if necessary and rolled with roller.

Unless otherwise instructed or agreed by the Engineer, the spreading shall be done by
the use of motor grader of adequate capacity. Spreader boxes shall be self-propelled
wheel type or tracked vehicles and adjustable to place the material in layers of the

specified thickness without undue disturbance to the prepared surface. The blades of a
motor grader should be hydraulically controlled for initial adjustment for maintaining the
required slope and grade during the operation. The granular material shall be placed in
uniform layers with each layer of compacted thickness varying from 100mm to 225mm

(using suitable type of rollers for different thicknesses of layers). Mixing of the sub-base

material shall be done mechanically. Manual mixing shall not be done except with the
specific prior approval of Engineer.

Compaction

Immediately following final spreading and smoothing, each layer shall be compacted to
full width by means of smooth-wheel / pad foot drum power rollers of weight 80- 100 kN
to 200-300KN as suitable, heavy pneumatic-tyred rollers of minimum tyre pressure of 0.7
MN/sqm or other approved compaction equipment. Rolling shall progress gradually from
the low to the high point of the cross section parallel to the center line of the road, and
shall continue until the entire surface has been rolled. Generally, light rollers with low
speed shall be used for first compactions, and then heavy rollers shall be used for
continuous compaction to the required compaction. Each pass of the roller shall
uniformly overlap not less than one-third of the track made in the preceding pass. Speed
of the roller shall not exceed 5 km per hour.

During compaction the grade and crossfall (camber) shall be checked and any
irregularities or depressions that develop shall be corrected by loosening the material at
these places and adding or removing material until the surface is smooth and uniform.
At all places not accessible to the roller, the material shall be compacted thoroughly with
agreed tampers or compactors. The material shall be both bladed and rolled until a
smooth, even surface has been obtained. Where surfaces fail to meet the tolerance
requirement the Contractor shall remove and replace the material.

Granular material shall be compacted to produce the required density through the full
depth of each layer of at least 98 percent of the maximum density determined in
accordance with IS: 2720 — 1983 (Part 8). In place field density determinations will be
made in accordance with IS: 2720 — 1974 (Part 28). Test holes at random during
progress of the work shall be made for measurement to confirm compliance with the
Specification and to determine the depth of un-compacted layers required to produce
the designated nominal depth of material placed. Cutting the test holes and refilling with
materials properly compacted shall be done by the Contractor.

6.1.5 Surface Finish and Quality Control of Work

layer and adding fresh material and re-compacting to the required density.

Compaction Control

Evaluation of density results and acceptance criteria for compaction control shall be as
under

Control shall be exercised on each layer by taking at least one measurement of density
for each 1000 square metres of compacted area, or closer as required to yield the
minimum number of test results for evaluating a day's work on statistical basis. The
determination of density shall be in accordance with IS: 2720 (Part-28), Test locations
shall be chosen only through random sampling techniques. Control shall not be based
on the result of anyone test but on the mean value of a set of 5-10 density
determinations. The number of tests in one set of measurements shall be 6 (if non-
destructive tests are carried out, the number of tests shall be doubled). If considerable
variations are observed between individual density results, the minimum number of tests
in one set of measurement shall be increased to 10. The acceptance criteria shall be

The final gradation approved within these limits shall be well graded from coarse to fine and
shall not vary from the low limit on one sieve to the high limit on the adjacent sieve or vice
versa.

Method of sampling and testing of materials shall be as required by the “Hand Book of Quality
Control for Construction of Roads and Runways” (IRC: SP: 11) and these Specifications

Construction

WMM material shall not be placed, spread or compacted while the rain is falling, and no
compaction shall be carried out when the moisture content of the material fall outside the
specification range. in locations where base materials are to be placed on a prepared sub-
base, the sub-base shall be prepared to the specified lines and cross fall (camber) in
accordance with Clause 6.1 of these Specifications prior to base placement. Any ruts or soft
yielding places shall be corrected & rolled until firm surface is achieved. While constructing wet
mix macadam, arrangement shall be made for the lateral confinement of Wet Mix.

(1) Trial sections

(i) Before WMM construction is started, the Contractor shall spread and compact trial
sections. The purpose of the trial sections is to check the suitability of the materials
and suitability & efficiency of the equipment and construction method which is
proposed to be used by the Contractor. Therefore, the Contractor must use the
same materials, equipment and procedures he proposes to use for the main work.
One trial section about 50m shall be made for every type of material and/or
construction equipment/procedure proposed for use.

(ii) Density tests and other tests required as per IS: 2720- 1983 (Part 8)

(iii) Engineer considers materials not to be suitable for base course as appropriate to
the trial, the material shall be removed at the Contractor's expense, and a new trial
section shall be constructed.

(iv) If the basic conditions regarding the type of material or procedure change during
the execution of the work, new trial sections shall be constructed.

(2) Preparation of Mix

Wet Mix Macadam shall be prepared in an approved mixing plant of suitable capacity
having provision for controlled addition of water and forced/positive mixing arrangement
like pugmill or pan type mixer of concrete batching plant. Manual mixing shall not be
done except with the specific prior approval of Engineer.

)

Optimum moisture for mixing shall be determined in accordance with IS:2720 (Part 8)
after replacing the aggregate fraction retained 22.4 mm sieve with material of 4.75 mm
to 22.4 mm size. While adding water, due allowance should be made for evaporation
losses. However, at the time of compaction, water in the wet mix should not vary from
the optimum value by more than agreed limits.

Spreading

The aggregates shall be spread uniformly and evenly upon the prepared subgrade/sub-
base in required quantities.

Unless otherwise instructed or agreed by the Engineer, the spreading shall be done by
the use of paver finisher or motor grader of adequate capacity. The blades of a motor
grader should be hydraulically controlled for initial adjustment for maintaining the
required slope and grade during the operation. Surface of aggregates and layers as
spread shall be checked with templates and depth blocks. The aggregates as spread
should be uniform gradation with no pockets of fine materials

The material shail be placed in uniform layers with each layer of compacted thickness
varying from 100 mm to 200 mm (using suitable type of rollers for different thicknesses
of layers).

Compaction

Immediately following final spreading and smoothing, each layer shall be compacted to
full width by means of smooth-wheel / vibratory rollers of weight 80- 100 kN or other
approved compaction equipment. Rolling shall progress gradually from the low to the
high point of the cross section parallel to the center line of the road, and shall continue
until the entire surface has been rolled. Generally, light rollers with low speed shall be
used for first compactions, and then heavy rollers shall be used for continuous
compaction to the required compaction. Each pass of the roller shall uniformly overlap
not less than one-third of the track made in the preceding pass. Speed of the roller shall
not exceed 5 km per hour.

Any irregularities or depressions that develop and exceed 12mm when tested with a 3
meter straight edge, shall be corrected by loosening the material at these places and
adding or removing material until the surface is smooth and uniform confirming to
desired grade and crossfall. At all places not accessible to the roller, the material shall
be compacted thoroughly with agreed tampers or compactors. Where surfaces fail to
meet the tolerance requirement the Contractor shall remove and replace the material.

Base material shall be compacted to produce the required density through the full depth
of each layer of at least 98 percent of the maximum density determined in accordance
with IS: 2720 — 1983 (Part 8). In place field density determinations will be made in
accordance with IS: 2720 — 1974 (Part 28). Test holes at random during progress of the
work shall be made for measurement to confirm compliance with the Specification and
to determine the depth of un-compacted layers required to produce the designated
nominal depth of material placed. Cutting the test holes and refilling with materials
properly compacted shall be done by the Contractor. After final compaction of wet mix
macadam course, the road shall be allowed to dry for 24 hours.

6.3.5 Surface Finish and Quality Control of Work

Cement conforming to 1S:8112 and 1S:12269 may be used provided the minimum cement
content mentioned elsewhere from durability considerations is not reduced. From strength
considerations, these cements shall be used with a certain caution as high early strengths of
cement in the 1 to 28-day range can be achieved by finer grinding and higher constituent ratio
of Tricalcium Silicate and Dicalcium Silicate. In such cements, the further growth of strength
beyond say 4 weeks may be much lower than that traditionally expected. Therefore, further
strength tests shall be carried out for 56 and 90 days to fine tune the mix design from strength
considerations.

Cement conforming to |S:12330 shall be used when sodium sulphate and magnesium sulphate
are present in large enough concentration to be aggressive to concrete. It shall not be used
under such conditions where concrete is exposed to risk of excessive chlorides and sulphates
attack both. The recommended threshold values as per IS: 456 are sulphate concentration in
excess of 0.2 per cent in soil substrata or 300 ppm (0.03per cent) in ground water. Tests to
confirm actual values of sulphate concentration are essential when the structure is located near
the sea coast, chemical factories, agricultural land using chemical fertilizers and sites where
there are effluent discharges or where soluble sulphate bearing ground water level is high.
Cement conforming to IS: 12330 shall be carefully selected from strength considerations to
ensure that the minimum required design strength can be achieved without exceeding the
maximum permissible cement content of 500 kg/cum of concrete,

Cement conforming to |S:8041 shall be used only for precast concrete products with prior
consent of the Engineer.

Piling Work

Description

This work shall consist of construction of all types of piles for structures in accordance with the
details shown on the drawings and conforming to the requirements of these specifications.

The construction of pile foundations requires a careful choice of the piling system depending
upon sub-soil conditions and loading characteristics and type of structure. The permissible
limits of total and differential settlements, unsupported length of pile under scour, impact /
entanglement of floating bodies and any other special requirements of project are also equally
important criteria for selection of the piling system.

Submittals

The method of installing the piles, including details of the equipment shall be submitted by the
Contractor and got approved from the Engineer.

The work shall be done as per 1S:2911 except as modified herein.
Sub-surface Investigation

The complete sub-surface investigation of strata in which pile foundations are proposed shall
be carried out in advance and by in-situ pile tests. The sub-surface investigations shall be
carried out meeting the requirements as specified in Clause 15.4 of Employer's Requirements —
General (Volume II of the Bid Documents) and Clause 4 of these Specifications (Volume III of
Bid documents) .. Borings should be carried upto sufficient depths so as to ascertain the
nature of strata around the pile shaft and below the pile tip. However, depth of boring shall not
be less than :

a) 1.5 times estimated length of pile in soil but not less than 15 m beyond the probable
length of pile

b) 15 times diameter of pile in weak/jointed rock but minimum 15 m in such rock
c) 4 times diameter of pile in sound, hard rock but minimum 3 m in such rock

The sub-surface investigation shall define adequately stratification of sub-strata including the
nature and type of strata, its variation and extent and specific properties of the same. The
investigation shall be adequate for the purpose of selection of appropriate piling system and for
estimating design capacities for different diameters and length of piles.

Pressure meter tests may be used in the case of rock, gravel or soil for direct evaluation of
strength and compressibility characteristic. Though these tests are of specialised nature they
are most appropriate for difficult/uncertain sub-strata especially for important projects.

For piles socketed into rocks, it is necessary to determine the uniaxial compressive strength of
the rock and its quality.

The investigation shall also include location of ground water table and other parameters
including results of chemical tests showing sulphate and chloride content and any other
deleterious chemical content in soil and/or ground water, likely to affect durability.

Type of Piles

The piles shall be of reinforced concrete. Concrete piles shall be bored cast-in-situ or driven
precast or precast piles driven into preformed bores. The shape of piles may be circular or any
other shape consented by Engineer

Pile Installation

Installation of piles shall be carried out as per pile layout drawings, installation criteria and
methodology as consented by the Engineer.

Lengthening of Piles

Where a pile is to have another length cast on it during driving, the longitudinal reinforcement
shall preferably be joined by full penetration butt welding. The concrete at the top of the original
pile shall be cut down to expose not less than 200 mm of the bars to avoid spalling of the
concrete by heat. The added bars have to be held accurately and rigidly in position during
welding. Where facilities on site are insufficient to make proper butt welding practicable, the
joint may be made by lapping. The reinforcement at the head of pile will need to be exposed for
full anchorage length or 600 mm whichever is greater and the new bars over- lapped for this
distance. Unless otherwise specified, the extension of the pile shall be formed to the same
cross-sectional profile and with concrete of at least the same strength as that specified for the
original pile. The stirrup spacing shall in no case be greater than 150 mm. Not more than one
extension shall be permitted. In case more than one extension is permitted by the Engineer,
only approved mechanical couplers shall be used. Driving shall not be resumed until:

a) The strength of the concrete in the extension is al least equal to the specified
characteristic strength of concrete in pile, and

b) The approval of the Engineer has been obtained.
Removal of Surplus Length

Any length of pile surplus to that required for incorporation in the structure shall be cut off neatly
and removed. During the process of cutting off, it shall be ensured that projecting reinforcement
to be anchored into the pile cap and the pre-stressing strands/wires are not damaged.
Reference may also be made to clause 7.7.1, of 1S:2911 (Part | Section 3) in this connection.

Risen Piles

Level reading should be taken on each pile after driving and again after all the piles are driven.
Piles which are found to have risen due to ground heave or as a result of driving adjacent piles,
shall be re-driven to the original depth or resistance unless re-driving tests on adjacent piles
have shown this to be unnecessary.

Manufacture

The pile should be cast in one continuous operation from end to end of each pile. Manufacture
of precast concrete piles shall conform to the guidelines contained in clause Nos. 7.1, 7.2 and
7.3 of 1S:2911 (Part !, Section 3).

Pile shall be provided with suitable shoe for protecting the point of the pile during driving in hard
ground.

the impact during driving.

Casing / liner shall be driven open ended with a pile driving hammer or bailer capable of

achieving penetration of the casing / liner to the length shown on the drawing. Materials
inside the casing shall be removed by the means consented by Engineer.

Where bored cast- in-situ piles are used in soils liable to flow, the bottom of the casing
shall be kept enough in advance of the boring toot to prevent the entry of soil into the
casing. The water level in the casing should generally be maintained at the natural
ground water level. The joints of the casing shall be made tight to minimise inflow of
water or leakage of slurry during concreting.

In case hard rock is encountered, chiseling shall essentially be required for softening of
the rock and the same shall be done with the consent of the Engineer at no extra cost to
the Employer. In case of use of rotary hydraulic drilling rig, advancement of pile bore shall
be done by drilling only.

The piles shall be founded on hard rock or soft rock or other suitable strata as consented
by the Engineer. Where the pile is founded in hard rock, a minimum embedment as
indicated below shall be ensured

(vii) While concreting the tremie shall be withdrawn slowly ensuring adequate height of
concrete outside the tremie pipe at all stages of withdrawal.

(viii) All tremie tubes should be scrupulously cleaned after use.

(6) The first charge of concrete should be placed with a sliding plug pushed down the tremie
tube ahead of it to prevent mixing of water and concrete.

(7) The concrete shall be properly graded, self-compacting and shall not get mixed with soil,
excess water, or other extraneous matter. Special care shall be taken in silty clays and
other soils with the tendency to squeeze into the newly deposited concrete and cause
necking. Sufficient head of green concrete shall be maintained to prevent inflow of soil or
water into the concrete.

(8) The time interval between the completion of the boring and start of concreting shall not
exceed 6 hours. In case this time interval exceeds 6 hours, the further activities in the
pile bore and handling of the pile bore shall be subject to the consent of the Engineer and
at no extra cost to the Employer. Placing of concrete shall be a continuous process from
the toe level to the top of the pile. To ensure compaction by hydraulic static heads, rate of
placing concrete in the pile shaft shall not be less than 6 m (length of pile) per hour.

(9) Segregation of the ingredients should be prevented. The displacement or distortion of

concrete at cutoff level for proper embedment in to the pile cap. The cutoff level of the
piles shall be as indicated in the Drawings.

(14) It shall be ensured that the volume of the concrete poured is atleast equal to the
theoretically computed volume of the pile shaft being cast. Accordingly a continuous
record shall be kept by the Contractor as to the volume of concrete placed in relation to
the pile length cast. For the purpose, soundings shall be taken recording the rise in
concrete level after each concrete pour in the Pile. Accordingly, a graph of concrete
actually poured vs theoretical concrete required for various depths of pile shall also be
prepared by the Contractor.

(15) For long or large diameter piles, use of retarding plasticiser in concrete is desirable.

(16) Where possible, it may be desirable to grout the base of pile with cement slurry under
suitable pressure after concrete in the pile attains the desired strength. For this purpose,
conduit pipes with easily removable plugs at the bottom end should be placed in the bore
along with reinforcement cage before concreting

Building Up of Piles / Breaking Off of Piles

If any pile, already cast as per construction drawing, requires any extra casting due to any
change in Cut-off-Level, then the pile shall be built up by using at least one grade higher
concrete than specified for piles, ensuring proper continuity with the existing concrete and to
the satisfaction of the Engineer. Necessary reinforcement, as per design requirement and
suitable shuttering shall be provided, before casting the concrete. Surrounding soil shall also be
built up to the required level by proper compaction, to ensure lateral capacity of the pile.

If any pile already cast requires breaking, due to subsequent change of Cut-off-Level, then the
same shall be carried out, not before seven days of casting without affecting the quality of
existing pile, such as loosening, cracking etc., and to the satisfaction of the Engineer.

Preparation of Pile Head

The area surrounding the piles shall be excavated upto the bottom of the pile caps. After seven
days of concreting of pile. The exposed part of concrete above the Cut-off Level shall be
removed / chipped off and made rough at Cut-off Level. Any defective concrete at the head of
the completed pile shall be cut away and made good with new concrete.

The clear cover between thte bottom reinforcement in pile cap from the top of the pile shall be
not less than 25 mm. The projected reinforcement above Cut-off Level shall be properly
cleaned and bent to the required shape and level to be anchored into the pile cap.

The minimum embedment of cast- in-situ concrete piles into the pile cap shall be 150 mm or
clear cover to reinforcement whichever is higher.

All loose material on the top of pile head after chipping to the desired level shall be removed and
disposed off.

100mm Dia Bore Hole

(1) Bore hole shall be made as per |S: 1892 for determining (which is one of the criteria of
establishing) start of socketing horizon and termination level of piles. Standard
Penetration Test (SPT), as per |S: 2131, in a bore hole shall be conducted at 1.0 m
interval in the overburden soil and rock portion having core recovery < 30%.

(2) Number of bore holes for determining termination shall vary depending on the site
condition and as decided by the Engineer. In case of uniform strata, 1 borehole may be
sufficient for 40-50 piles or in a pile group. In case of erratic strata, the number of
boreholes may be 1 in 20 to 40 piles. However, at the location of initial load test piles,
one such borehole shall be done at each location.

Sequencing of Piling
(1) In a pile group the sequence of installation of piles shall normally be from the centre to
the periphery of the group or from one side to the other.

(2) Consideration should be given to the possibility of doing harm to a pile recently formed
by driving the tube nearby before the concrete has sufficiently set. The danger of doing
harm is greater in compact soils than in loose soils.

(3) Driving piles in loose sand tends to compact the sand which, in turn, increases the skin
friction. Therefore, the order of installing of such a pile in a group should avoid creating a
compacted block of ground into which further piles cannot be driven.

(4) In case where stiff clay or compact sand layers have to be penetrated, similar
precautions need be taken. This may be overcome by driving the piles from the centre to
outward or by beginning at a selected edge and working across the group. However, in
case of very soft soils, the driving may have to proceed from outside to inside so that the

soil is restrained from flowing out during the operations.

Driving Equipment

Piles or their casings may be driven with any type of drop hammer, diesel hammer or single-
acting steam or compressed air hammer, provided they penetrate to the prescribed depth or
attain the designed resistance without being damaged. The weight or power of the hammer
should be sufficient to ensure a penetration of at least 5 mm per blow, unless rock has been
reached. The minimum weight of the hammer shall be 2.5t. In the case of precast concrete
piles, the mass of the hammer shall be not less than 30 times the mass of 300 mm length of
pile. Steam or air hammers shall be furnished along with boiler or air compressor (along with
pressure gauge) of capacity at least equal to that specified by the manufacturer of the
hammers. The valve mechanism and other parts of steam, air or diesel hammers shall be
maintained so that the length of stroke and number of blows per minute for which the hammer
is designed, will be obtained.

Driving
General

Details of the equipment and the method proposed for driving the piles shall be subject to
approval of the Engineer. The arrangement for pile installation shall provide sufficient rigidity to
ensure accuracy of pile driving under all conditions of tide, stream flow or hammer drop.

During driving the top of pile shall be protected by a suitable helmet to provide uniform bearing
across the top of the pile and hold the pile centrally. The force of the hammer shall be directed
centrally and axially during driving. The stroke of a single acting or drop hammer shall be
limited to 1.2 m unless otherwise permitted by the Engineer. The pile shall be effectively guided
and held on-line during driving. Attempts to correct any tendency for the pile to run off- line by
the application of significant horizontal restraint will not be permitted.

Throughout the driving operation, checks shall be made to ensure that the pile frame does not
exert any lateral force on the pile. If the indications are that a pile will finish outside the
specified tolerances, driving operations on that pile will cease, the pile shall be withdrawn, the
hole filled and the pile re-driven at no extra cost.

To avoid the possibility of premature "set-up" pile driving shall be continuous in the later stages,
without any deliberate stops. If any pile is damaged in any way during driving, it shall be
repaired or replaced as consented by Engineer at no extra cost.

If during driving, the head of a pile is damaged to the extent that further driving is not possible,
the head shall be cut off and driving continued. The cost of cutting off shall be borne by the
Contractor and where, as a result of such cutting off the head, the pile is too short, the
Contractor, shall, at his own cost, supply and splice on sufficient length of pile to restore the pile
to its correct length.

Piles should be driven to the minimum acceptable penetration shown on the drawings. This
may require preboring and/or jetting with the prior consent of Engineer.

Piles shall be driven to nominal refusal or the required ultimate dynamic capacity nominated on
the drawings or until the top of the pile is at the level required and specified on the drawing
whichever gives the lowest toe elevation. Nominal refusal shall be taken as equivalent to 25
mm total penetration for the final 20 blows using a hammer of driving energy as specified and
shall be used as the criterion for acceptance for piles founded on rock. Severe driving which
results in an average set per blow less than 0.5 mm will not be permitted. Where hard drilling is
encountered because of dense strata or obstructions located above the predetermined pile tip
level, nominal refusal shall not be considered to have been achieved unless the total number of
blows, as the average driving resistance specified for nominal refusal, indicates that further
driving will not advance the pile through dense strata or obstructions.

The pile shall be driven as accurately as possible to the vertical or to specified batter. If the
deviation is to such an extent that the resulting eccentricity cannot be taken care of by

strengthening the pile cap or pile ties, such a pile shall be replaced or supplemented by an
additional pile, subject to approval of Engineer.

No pile shall be bored or driven within 3 m of a newly cast pile until at least 24 hours after
completion of its installation. Driving a number of friction piles in piles in loose sand and stiff
clay shall proceed outward from the centre as otherwise it will be difficult to drive the inner piles
to the same depth as the others. However, in case of very soft soil, the driving may proceed
from outside to inside, so that the soil is restrained from flowing out during driving operations.

lf there is a major variation between the depth at which adjacent foundation piles in a group
meet refusal, a boring shall be made nearby to ascertain the cause of this difference. If the
boring shows that the soil contains pockets of highly compressive material below the level of
the shorter pile, it will be necessary to enforce penetration of all the piles to a level below the
bottom of the zone which shows such pockets.

Preboring and Jetting

Driving of the piles may be assisted by preboring holes or by the use of jets or both subject to
the prior approval of the Engineer.

The diameter of the hole shall not be greater than the diagonal dimension of the pile less 100
mm.

The maximum depth of the preboring shall be such that the specified set (or less) is obtained
when the toe of the pile is at founding level. Preboring shall not extend below one meter above
the founding level and the pile shall be driven to at least one meter below the prebored hole.
Any space remaining around the pile at the ground level after driving is finished shall be
backfilled with approved granular material.

When water jetting is used, at least two jets shall be attached to the pile symmetrically. The
maximum depth of jetting shall be such that the specified set (or less) is obtained when the toe
of the pile is at founding level. Jetting shall not proceed below one meter above the founding
level and the pile shall be driven at least one meter below the pre-bored hole.

To avoid very hard driving and vibration in materials such as sand, jetting of piles by means of
water may be carried out in such a manner as not to impair the baring capacity of piles already
in place, the stability of the soil or the safety of any adjoining buildings. Necessary
arrangements should be made for collection of water when it comes to the ground surface, so
that the stability of the piling plant is not endangered by the softening of the ground.

Jetting shall be stopped before completing the driving which shall always be finished by
ordinary methods. Jetting shall be stopped if there is any tendency for the pile tips to be drawn
towards the pile already driven owing to the disturbance to the ground.

Pile Tests / Acceptance of Pile

For acceptance of piles, vertical and lateral load, testing of piles as required will be carried out
as per procedure laid down in IS : 2911 (Pt-IV) “ Code of Practice for Design and Construction
of Pile Foundation -Load test on piles.”

The bearing capacity of a single pile may be determined from test loading a pile. The load test
on a concrete pile may not be carried out earlier than 28 days from the time of casting of the
pile. The test pile head shall be prepared one week after casting the pile.

Type of Tests

There shall be three categories of tests on piles, namely, initial load tests, routine load tests and
pile integrity tests.

(1) _ Initial Load Test

Initial load tests should be carried out on test piles, which are not to be incorporated in
the work, to assess the safe load carrying capacity of the pile before start of installation

(b) Lateral load test for lateral load capacity
(3) Pile Integrity Tests
Pile integrity testing shall be used as a method of proof testing a pile as work progress
with the aim of indirectly assessing one or more of the following
(a) Structural integrity of the pile
(b) The relative shape of the pile shaft and an estimate of the physical dimension of
the pile
(c) The continuity of the pile
(4) Where integrity testing is required, the test to be adopted shall be one of the following
(a) Sonic Impact Test
(b) Sonic Vibration Test
The scheme of the test shall be as consented by the Engineer. Pile tests shall be
carried out under the direct supervision of the person having experience in supervision
of pile integrity tests
Number of Tests

The number of initial and routine load tests on piles shall be as consented by the Engineer
depending upon the number of foundations, span length, type of superstructure and
uncertainties of founding strata. In any case, the initial load tests shall not be less than 2 in
number for each structure, while the routine load tests shall not be less than 2 per cent of the
total number of piles in the structure nor less than 2 in number. Test piles for routine load test
shall be identified by the Engineer. These stipulations hold good for both vertical as well as
lateral load tests on pile foundations. However, both initial and routine tests may be suitably
increased for important structures or cases with large variation in the subsurface strata as
directed by the Engineer.

Pile Integrity Tests has to be conducted on 100% of the piles on each Bridge

The load shall be applied to the pile top in increments (steps ) of about 20%
of the rated capacity of the pile or as directed by Engineer. Each increment of
load shall be applied as smoothly and expeditiously as possible. Settlement
reading shall be taken before and immediately after the application of next
increment and at 15, 30 minutes and thereafter at every 1/2 hour until
application of the next load increment.

Each stage of loading shall be maintained till the rate of movement of the pile
top is not more than 0.2mm / hr or until two hours have elapsed, whichever is
earlier.

The rate of movement of pile shall not be permitted to be extrapolated from
period of test less than one hour.

Loading on the pile shall be continued till one of the following takes place:
> Incase of initial load test
Applied load reaches three times the safe vertical load carrying

capacity

OR
The maximum settlement of pile exceeds a value of 10 percent of
pile diameter.

> Incase of Routine Load Test

Applied load reaches one and half times the safe vertical load
carrying capacity

OR
The maximum settlement of Test Loading in position attains 12mm.

Where yielding of the soil / rock does not occur, full test load shall be
maintained on the pile head for a minimum period of 24 hrs, after the last
increment of load has been applied. Settlement /values shall be recorded at
every 6 hrs interval during this period.

Unloading shall be carried out in the same steps as loading. A minimum
period of 30 minutes shall be allowed to elapse between two successive
stages of load decrement. The final rebound shall be recorded 6 hours after
the entire test load has been removed.

Assessment of Safe Load

The safe vertical load carrying capacity of single pile from the initial and routine vertical
load tests shall be the least of the following values:

(a) Two-third of the final load, at which the total settlement is 12mm

(b) 50 percent of the final load, at which the total settlement equals to 10 percent of the
pile diameter

in case of any doubt of workmanship or load carrying capacity of working piles not subjected to
routine tests, or when ordered by the Engineer, load tests on working piles may be
supplemented by non-destructive testing, other than Pile Integrity Tests, which gives an
indication of pile capacity in end bearing and side friction.

Pile Cap

Pile Caps shall be of reinforced concrete. A minimum offset of 150 mm shall be provided
beyond the outer faces of the outer most piles in the group. If the pile cap is in contact with
earth at the bottom, a leveling course of minimum 100 mm thickness of M 15 nominal mix
concrete shall be provided.

The attachment of the pile head to the cap shall be adequate for the transmission of loads and
forces. A portion of pile top may be stripped of concrete and the reinforcement anchored into
the cap. Manual chipping may be permitted after three days of pile casting, while pneumatic
tools for chipping shall not be used before seven days after pile casting. The top of pile after
stripping shall project at least 150 mm into the pile cap. A layer of surface reinforcement may
be provided with a cover of 25 mm to retain the integrity of concrete below the main cap
reinforcement which is to be laid 25 mm above the pile top.

Concreting of the pile cap shall be carried out in dry conditions. The bottom of the pile cap shall
be laid preferably as low as possible taking account of the water level prevalent at the time of
casting. The top of concrete in a pile shall be brought above cut-off level to permit removal of all
laitance and weak concrete before pile cap is laid. This will ensure good concrete at the cut-off
level.

Tolerances
Permissible Tolerances for Pile shall be as per Table 8.2 below

Concrete Works

General

This section refers to the construction of concrete structures including concrete mix design, trial
mix, testing and workmanship for concreting. The work shall consist of furnishing and placing
structural concrete and incidental construction in accordance with these Specifications and in
conformity with the lines, grades and dimensions, as shown on the approved drawings.

Durability : The durability of concrete depends on its resistance to deterioration and the
environment in which it is placed. The resistance of concrete to weathering, chemical attack,
abrasion, frost and fire depends largely upon its quality and constituents materials.
Susceptibility to corrosion of the steel is governed by the cover provided and the permeability of
concrete. The cube crushing strength alone is not a reliable guide to the quality and durability of
concrete; it must also have an adequate cement content and a low water-cement ratio. The
general environment to which the concrete will be exposed during its working life is classified in
three levels of severity that is moderate, severe and extreme, as described in Table 9.2 below

With Strong, dense aggregates, a suitably low permeability is achieved by having a sufficiently
low water-cement ratio, by ensuring as thorough compaction of the concrete as possible and by
ensuring sufficient hydration of cement through proper curing methods. Therefore, for given
aggregates, the cement content should be sufficient to provide adequate workability with a low
water-cement ratio so that concrete can be completely compacted by vibration. Test procedure
for penetration measuring permeability has been given in Appendix-G of IRS Concrete Bridge
Code-1997. The depth of penetration of moisture shall not exceed 25mm.

Proportioning of Concrete

Prior to the start of construction, the Contractor shall design the mix and submit to the Engineer
for approval, the proportions of materials, including admixtures to be used. Water-reducing
admixtures (including plasticisers or super-plasticisers) may be used at the Contractor's option,
subject to the approval of the Engineer. Other types of admixtures shall be prohibited, unless
specifically permitted by the Engineer.

Requirements of Consistency

The mix shall have the consistency which will allow proper placement and consolidation in the
required position. Every attempt shall be made to obtain uniform consistency.

The optimum consistency for various types of structures shall be as indicated in Table 9.7
below or as consented by the Engineer. The slump of concrete shall be checked as per IS: 516.

produced at site by the same plant under similar supervision, over a period
exceeding 5 days, but not exceeding 6 months.

Concrete of each grade shall be analysed separately to determine its standard
deviation. The standard deviation of concrete of a given grade shall be calculated
using the following formula from the results of individual tests of concrete of that
grade obtained as specified in the “Tests and Standards of Acceptance” of this

Estimated standard deviation Sd= ¥v ZA2/(n-1)

Where, A is the deviation of the individual test strength from the average strength
of n samples and n is the number of sample test results.

When significant changes are made in the production of concrete batches (for
example changes in the materials used, mix design, equipment or technical
control), the standard deviation value shall be separately calculated for such
batches of concrete and current margin as well as target mean strength shall be
worked out again.

Where there is insufficient data to satisfy the above, the current margin for the
initial design mix shall be taken as given in Table 9.8 below

transported and tested in accordance with these specifications. The average strength of
the nine cubes at 28 days shall exceed the specified characteristic strength by the
current margin minus 3.5 MPa.

Control of Strength of Design Mixes
(i) Adjustment to Mix Proportion

Adjustments to mix proportions arrived at in the trial mixes shall be made subject to
the approval of Engineer, in order to minimise the variability of strength and to
maintain the target mean strength. Such adjustments shall not be taken to imply
any change in the current margin.

(ii) Change of Current Margin

When required by the Engineer, the Contractor shall recalculate the current margin
in accordance with procedure specified above. The recalculated value shall be
adopted as consented by the Engineer, and it shall become the current margin fur

and aggregate or adding the cement to the aggregate, whichever is earlier. Time of such
introduction shall be recorded on the delivery note together with the weight of
constituents of each mix. In case, location of site of construction is such that this time
period is considered inadequate, increased time period may be specified provided that
properties of concrete have been tested after lapse of the proposed delivery period at
the time of finalising mix design.

When concrete is conveyed by chute, the plant shall be of such size and design as to ensure

practically continuous flow. Slope of the chute shall be so adjusted that the concrete flows
without the use of excessive quantity of water and without segregation of its ingredients.

in case of pumped concrete conveyed by pressure through rigid pipe or flexible hose and
discharged directly in to the desired area, the pumping rate should be 10 to 70m3 per hour.
Effective pumping range is 300m horizontally and 90m vertically.

All formwork and reinforcement contained in it shall be cleaned and made free from standing
water & dust.

All comers of concrete shall have chamfers of 25mm

No concrete shall be placed in any part of the structure until the consent of the Engineer has
been obtained.

If concreting is not started within 24 hours of the consent being given, it shall have to be
obtained again from the Engineer. Concreting then shall proceed continuously over the area
between the construction joints. Fresh concrete shall not be placed against concrete which has
been in position for more than 30 minutes unless a proper construction joint is formed.

Except where otherwise consented to by the Engineer, concrete shall be deposited in
horizontal layers to a compacted depth of not more than 450 mm when intemal vibrators are
used. Concrete cover blocks of the same strength and density as parent concrete shall be
used.

Concrete when deposited shall have a temperature of not less than 5 degrees Celsius, and not
more than 40 degrees Celsius, It shall be compacted in its final position within 30 minutes of its
discharge from the mixer or agitator (in case of Ready Mixed Concrete) as the case may be,

No concrete shail be allowed without vibration except under water concreting or tremie
concreting.

Concrete shall be thoroughly compacted by vibration during placing and worked around the
reinforcement, tendons or duct formers, embedded fixtures and into corners of the formwork to
produce a dense homogeneous void- free mass having the required surface finish. To achieve
proper compaction mechanical vibrators shall be used. The vibrators can be internal or external
type and depending on the shape and size of the member, both the types may be used in
combination. When internal vibrators are used, they shall be used vertically to the full depth of
the layer being placed and shall penetrate into the layer below while it is still plastic to the
extent of 100mm. The vibrator shall be kept in place until air bubbles cease to escape from the
surface and then withdrawn siowly to ensure that no hole is left in concrete, care being taken to
see that it remains in continued operation while being withdrawn. Vibrators should not be used
to move the concrete as it can cause honeycombing.

Interna! vibrators shall be inserted in an orderly manner and distance between insertions should
be about 1.5 times the radius of the area visibly affected by vibration. For horizontal and vertical
operations of the vibrators, the spacing of points of vibration shall be such that the zone of
influence overlap

Form vibrators shail be used in addition to internal vibrators in case of pre-stressed concrete
girders / slabs etc.

The use of vibrators complying IS: 2505, 1S:2506, IS; 2514 and IS: 4656 for compacting the
concrete is recommended. Over-vibration and under vibration of concrete should be avoided .

Additional vibrators in serviceable condition shall be kept at site so that they can be used in the
event of breakdowns.

Concrete should be compacted before setting commences and should not be subsequently
disturbed

Bearing areas for members shall be finished to true plane so as to give uniform bearing on the
entire area. Bearing plane shall be horizontal even for the bridges on grade

(6) Clear cover shall be uniform and as per the drawings

Construction Joints

Construction joints shall be avoided as far as possible and in no case the locations of such
joints shall be changed or increased from those shown on the drawings, except with prior
consent of the Engineer in case of emergencies. The joints shall be provided in a direction
perpendicular to the member axis. Cold joints should be totally eliminated. The location of the
construction joint, procedure for surface preparation of construction joint and sequence of
concreting shall be subject to consent of the Engineer

Concreting shall be carried out continuously upto the construction joints, the position and
arrangement of which shall be predetermined by the designer.

The use of construction joints in pre-stressed concrete work should be avoided. However, if
found unavoidable, they shall be provided by adopting proper construction techniques.

Properly designed reinforcement shall be provided for transfer of full tensile stress across the
joints prior to casting of the next lift.

Position of Construction Joints:

(1) Construction joints should be positioned to minimise the effect of the discontinuity on the
durability, structural integrity and appearance of the structure.

(2) As far as possible, joints should be positioned in non-aggressive zones, but if
aggressive zones cannot be avoided, joints should be sealed.

Joints should be positioned where they are readily accessible for preparation and
concreting, the preparation of the joints is more likely to be satisfactory where the cross
section is relatively small and where reinforcement is not congested.

As far as possible, joints for fairfaced concrete should be located where they conform
with the architectural features of the construction. Unless they are masked in this way,
the position of the joints are always obvious, even when the concrete is given a textured
finish.

If substantial changes in the cross section of a member are necessary, the joints should
be formed where they minimise stresses caused by temperature gradients and
shrinkage.

Joints should be located away from regions of maximum stress caused by loading,
particularly where shear and bond stress are high. Construction joints between slabs
and ribs in composite beam should be avoided. As a general rule, joints in column are
made as near as possible to the beam hunching, joints in beams and slabs should
normally be made at the centre or within the middle third of the span.

ce)

(8)

The minimum number of joints should be used and their construction should be simple.
They should be either horizontal or vertical, because concreting sloping surfaces are
usually unsatisfactory.

Where concrete is placed in vertical members e.g. walls, columns and the like, the lift of
concrete shall finish level or at right angles to the axis of the member, the joint line
matching the features of the finished work. Concreting shall be carried out continuously
upto the construction joint.

Laitance, both on the horizontal and vertical surfaces of the concrete, should be
removed before fresh concrete is cast. The surface should be roughened to promote
good adhesion. Various methods for removal can be used but they should not dislodge
the coarse aggregate particles. Concrete may be brushed with a stiff brush soon after
casting while the concrete is still fresh, and while it has only slightly stiffened.

If the concrete has partially hardened, it may be treated by wire brushing or with a high
pressure water jet, followed by drying with an air jet, immediately before the new
concrete is placed.

Fully hardened concrete should be treated with mechanical hand tools or grill blasting,
taking care not to split or crack aggregate particles.

The best time for treating the joint is a matter of judgment because it depends on the
rate of setting and hardening (which is itself dependent on the temperature of the
concrete). Before further concrete is cast, the surface should be thoroughly cleaned to
remove debris and accumulated rubbish, one effective method, being air jet.

Where there is likely to be a delay before placing the next concrete lift, protruding
reinforcement should be protected. Before the next lift is placed, rust, loose mortar or
other contamination should be removed from the bars and where conditions are
particularly aggressive and there has been a substantial delay between lifts, the
concrete should be cut back to expose the bars for a length of about 50mm to ensure
that contaminated concrete is removed.

In all cases, when construction joints are made, to essential it is ensure that the joint
surface is not contaminated with release agents, dust or curing membrane, and that the
reinforcement is fixed firmly in position at the correct cover.

Concreting at Construction Joints

(1) When the form work is fixed for the next lift, it should be inspected to ensure that no
leakage can occur from the fresh concrete. It is a good practice to fix a 6mm thick
sponge which seals the gap completely.

(2) The practice of first placing a layer of mortar or grout is not recommended. The old
surface should be soaked with water without leaving puddles, immediately before
starting concreting, then the new concrete should be thoroughly compacted against it.
When fresh concrete is cast against existing mature concrete or masonry, the older
surfaces should be thoroughly cleaned and soaked to prevent the absorption of water
from the new concrete. Standing water should be removed shortly before the new
concrete is placed and the new concrete should be thoroughly vibrated in the region of
the joint.

in case of concreting in sea water, no construction joints shall be allowed within 600mm below
tow water level or within 600mm of upper and lower planes of wave action.

Concreting Under Water

When it is necessary to deposit concrete under water, the methods, equipment, materials and
proportions of mix to be used shall be subject to the consent of the Engineer before any work is
started. The weight of the coarse aggregates shall not be less than one and half times, not
more than twice that of the fine aggregates

Concrete shall not be placed in water having a temperature below 5 degrees Celsius, The
temperature of the concrete, when deposited, shall not be less than 16 degrees Celsius, nor
more than 40 degrees Celsius.

Coffer dams (wherever required) or forms shall be sufficiently tight to ensure still water
conditions, if practicable, and in any case to reduce the flow of water to less than 3 meters per
minute through the space into which concrete is to be deposited. Coffer dams or forms in still
water shall be sufficiently tight to prevent loss of mortar through the joints in the walls. Pumping
shall not be done while concrete is being placed or until 24 hours thereafter.

To minimise the formation of laitance, great care shall be exercised not to disturb the concrete
as far as possible while it is being deposited.

All under water concreting shall be carried out by tremie method only using tremie of
appropriate diameter. The number and spacing of the tremies should be worked out to ensure
proper concreting. The concrete production and placement equipment should be sufficient to
enable the underwater concrete to be completed uninterrupted within the stipulated time.
Necessary stand-by equipment should be available for emergency situation.

Concrete shall be deposited continuously until it is brought to the required height. While
depositing, the top surface shall be kept as nearly level as possible and the formation of seams
avoided. In the exceptional cases of interruption of concreting which can be resumed within 2
hours, the tremie shall not be taken out of the concrete. Instead it shall be raised and lowered
slowly from time to time to prevent the concrete around tremie from setting. Concreting should
be resumed by introducing a little richer concrete with a slump of about 200mm for easy
displacement of partly set concrete. All tremie tubes shall be properly cleaned before and after
use.

Tremie — The concrete should be coherent and slump shall be more than 150mm but it should
not exceed 180mm. When concrete is carried out under water a temporary casing should be
installed to the full depth of bore hole or 2m in to noncollapsible stratum, so that fragments of
ground cannot drop from the sides of the hole in the concrete as it is placed. The temporary
casing may not be required except near the top when concreting under drilling mud. The
hopper and tremie should be embedded in the placed concrete through which the water can not

pass. The top section of tremie shall be a hopper large enough to hold one entire batch of the
mix or the entire contents of the transporting bucket if any. The tremie pipe shall be not less
than 200mm in diameter and shall be large enough to allow a free flow of concrete and strong
enough to withstand the external pressure of the water in which it is suspended, even if a
partial vacuum develops inside the pipe. Preferably, flanged steel pipe of adequate strength for
the job should be used. A separate lifting device shall be provided for each tremie pipe with its
hopper at the upper end. Unless the lower end of the pipe is equipped with an approved
automatic check valve, the upper end of the pipe shall be plugged before delivering the
concrete to the tremie pipe through the hopper, so that when the concrete is forced down from
the hopper to the pipe, it will force the plug (and alongwith it any water in the pipe) down the
pipe and out of the bottom end, thus establishing a continuous stream of concrete. It will be
necessary to raise the tremie pipe by 25cm to 30cm slowly in order to cause a uniform flow of
the concrete, but the tremie shall not be emptied to avoid flow of water into the pipe. At all times
even while changing / adding pipes to tremie, the bottom of tremie pipe shall be atleast 600mm
below the top of concrete as ascertained by sounding. This will cause the concrete to build up
from below instead of flowing out over the surface, and thus avoid formation of laitance layers.
If the charge in the tremie is lost while depositing, the tremie shall be raised above the concrete
surface, and unless sealed by a check value, it shall be replugged at the top end, as at the
beginning, before refilling for depositing concrete-

In case of withdrawal of tremie out of the concrete either accidentally or to remove a choke in
the tremie, the tremie may be reintroduced in the following manner to prevent impregnation of
laitance or scum lying on top of the concrete deposited in the bore. The tremie shall be gently
lowered on to the old concrete with very little penetration initially. A vermuculite plug should be
introduced in the tremie. Fresh concrete of slump between 150 mm and 175 mm should be
filled in the tremie which will push the plug forward and will emerge out of the tremie displacing
the laitance/scum. The tremie will be pushed further in steps making fresh concrete sweep
away the laitance/scum in its way. When tremie is buried by about 0.60m to 1.0m, concreting
may be resumed.

In case of concreting through tremie or such tubes which are subsequently withdrawn, the
concrete shall be placed in sufficient quantity to ensure that during withdrawal of the tube a
sufficient head of concrete is maintained to prevent the in-flow of soil and water or bentonite
slurry

No concrete shall be allowed to come in contact with sea water within 72 hours of casting.

Protection and Curing

Concreting operations shall not commence until adequate arrangements for concrete curing
have been made by the Contractor. Curing and protection of concrete shall start immediately
after compaction of the concrete to protect it from :

a) Premature drying out particularly by solar radiation and wind

Moist Curing

The concrete should be kept constantly wet for a minimum period of 14 (fourteen) days. Water
should be applied on unformed surfaces as soon as it can be done without marring the surface
and on formed surfaces immediately after the forms are stripped. The concrete shall be kept
constantly wet by ponding or covered with a layer of sacking, canvas, hessian or a similar
absorbant material. When air temperature is expected to drop below 5°C during the curing
period, additional covering of cotton/gunny bags, straw or other suitable blanketing material
shall be provided so that concrete temperature at surface does not fall below 10°C.

Curing Compound

Approved curing compounds may be used in lieu of moist curing with the permission of the
engineer. Such compounds shall be applied to all exposed surfaces of the concrete along with
stripping of form work. Tests shall be done to ascertain :

a) Loss of moisture in concrete with and without curing compound.
b) Cube strength of concrete with moist curing and curing compound.
c) Permeability of concrete.

Curing compound shall not be used on any surface requiring further finishing to be applied. All
construction joints shall be moist, cured and no curing compound will be permitted in locations
where concrete surfaces are required to be bonded together.

Curing compounds shall be continuously agitated during use. Concrete to be cured by this
methods shall receive two applications of curing compound.

Steam Curing

Steam curing can be advantageously used to save time of curing of concrete for transfer of pre-
stress. The optimum steam curing cycle for a particular situation can only be determined by trial
and error. However, it has been found satisfactory to use a pre-steaming period of 4 to 5 hour
or rate of temperature rise between 22-33°C per hour and a maximum curing temperature of
66-82°C for a period such that entire curing cycle does not exceed 18 hour. Rapid temperature
changes during the cooling period should be avoided and drop in ambient temperature in the
enclosure is not sharper than 20°C per hour. The reuse of casting beds and forms along with
18 hour steam curing makes it a total 24 hour cycle. Pre-stress to members in pretension beds
should be transferred immediately after the termination of steam curing while the concrete and
forms are still warm, otherwise the temperature within the enclosure shall be maintained at over
15°C until the pre-stress is transferred to the concrete. The steam curing will be considered
complete when the concrete has reached the minimum strength at ‘Strength at Stress transfer’
or handling strength.

Finishing
Immediately after the removal of forms, exposed bars or bolts, if any, shall be cut inside the

concrete member to a depth of at least 50 mm below the surface of the concrete and the
resulting holes filled with suitable epoxy mortar.

All construction and expansion joints in the completed work shail be left carefully tooled and
free from any mortar and concrete. Expansion joint filler shall be left exposed for its full length
with clean and true edges.

Immediately on removal of forms, the concrete work shall be examined by the Engineer before
any defects are made good.

The work that has sagged or contains honeycombing to an extent detrimental to structural
safety or architectural appearance shall be rejected.

strands during concreting. It is also advisable that 3 to 4 hours after concreting,
the cable should be moved both ways through a distance of about 20 cms.
With such movement, any leakage of the mortar which has taken place in spite
of all precautions, loses bond with the cables, thus reducing the chance of
blockage. This operation can also be done by fixing pre-stressing jacks at one
end, pulling the entire cable and then repeating the operation by fixing the jack
at the other end. Compressed air should also be pumped to clear leaked
mortar. However the methodology of moving the cable during and after
concreting shall be subject to consent of the Engineer.

9.20 Load Testing
9.20.1 Load Test on Individual Precast Units

(1)

(2)

(3)

General

The load tests described in this clause are intended as checks on the quality of the units
and should not be used as a substitute for normal design procedures. Where members
require special testing, such special testing procedures should be in accordance with the
specification. Test loads are to be applied and removed incrementally.

Non-destructive Test

The unit should be supported at its designed points of support and loaded for 5 min. with
a load equal to the sum of the characteristic dead load plus 1.25 times the characteristic
imposed load. The deflection should then be recorded. The maximum deflection
measured after application of the load should be in accordance with the requirements
that should be defined by the engineer. The recovery should be measured 5 min. after
the removal of the applied load and the load then re-imposed. The percentage recovery
after the second loading should be not less than that after the first loading nor less than
90% of the deflection recorded during the second loading. At no time during the test
should the unit show any sign of weakness or faulty construction as defined by the
engineer in the light of reasonable interpretation of relevant data.

Special Test

For very large units, or units not readily amenable to tests (such as columns, the precast
parts of composite beams, and members designed for continuity or fixity) the testing
arrangements should be agreed before such units are cast.

9.20.2 Load Test of Structures or Parts of Structures

(1)

(2)

(3)

General

The tests described in this clause are intended as a check on structures other than
those covered by serviceability or strength.

Age at Test

The test should be carried out as soon as possible after the expiry of 28 days from the
time of placing the concrete. When the test is for a reason other than the quality of the
concrete in the structure being in doubt, the test may be carried out earlier provided that
the concrete has already reached its specified characteristic strength. When testing
prestressed concrete, allowance should be made for the effect of pre-stress at the time
of testing being above its final value.

Test Loads

The test loads to be applied for the limit states of deflection and local damage are the
appropriate design loads, i.e. the characteristic dead and imposed loads. When the
ultimate limit state is being considered, the test load should be equal to the sum of the
characteristic dead load plus 1.25 times the characteristic imposed load and should be
maintained for a period of 24h. If any of the final dead load is not in position on the
structure, compensating loads should be added as necessary. During the tests, struts
and bracing strong enough to support the whole load should be placed in position

leaving a gap under the members to be tested and adequate precautions should be
taken to safeguard persons in the vicinity of the structure.

(4) Measurements during the Tests
Measurements of deflection and crack width should be taken immediately after the
application of load and in the case of the 24h sustained load test at the end of the 24h-
loaded period after removal of the load and after the 24h recovery period. Sufficient
measurements should be taken to enable side effects to be taken into account.
Temperature and weather conditions should be recorded during the test.

(5) Assessment of Results
In assessing the serviceability of a structure or part of a structure following a loading
test, the possible effects of variation in temperature and humidity during the period of the
test should be considered. The following recommendations should be met.

(a) For reinforced concrete structures, the maximum width of any crack measured
immediately on application of the test load for local damage should not be more
than two thirds of the value for the limit state requirement as given in clause
10.2.10f the Code of Practice for Plain, Reinforced and Pre-stressed Concrete for
General Bridge Construction (Bridge Code) of Indian Railway. For pre-stressed
concrete structures, no visible cracks should occur under the test load for local
damage.

(b) For members spanning between two supports, the deflection measure
immediately after application of the test load for deflections should not be more
than 1/500 of the effective span. Limits should be agreed before testing
cantilever portions of structures.

(c) If the maximum deflection (in millimeters) shown during the 24h under load is
less than 40 L? /h where L is the eff ctive span (in meters) and h is the overall
depth of construction in (millimeters), it is not necessary for the recovery to be
measured and clause 9.20.2 (5) (d) and (e) below do not apply.

(d) If within 24h of the removal of the test load for the ultimate limit state as
calculated in 9.20.2 (3) above, a reinforced concrete structure does not show a
recovery of at least 75% of the maximum deflection shown during the 24h under
load, the loading should be repeated. The structure should be considered to have
failed to pass the test if the recovery after the second loading is not at least 75%
of the maximum deflection shown during the second loading;

(e) If within 24 h of the removal of the test load for the ultimate limit state as
calculated in 9.20.2 (3), a pre-stressed concrete structures does not a recovery
of at least 85% of the maximum deflection shown during the 24h under load, the
loading should be repeated. The structure should be considered to have failed to
pass the test if the recovery after the second loading is not at least 85% of the
maximum deflection shown during the second loading.

Non-destructive Tests (NDT)

Additional non destructive tests on the hardened concrete in the structure as a whole or any
finished part of the structure where necessary may be carried out to as certain its integrity of
strength. Details of few non-destructive techniques are given in Appendix-F of the Code of
Practice for Plain, Reinforced and Pre-stressed Concrete for General Bridge Construction
(Bridge Code) of Indian Railway

Painting on Bridges

General : Formwork shall include all temporary or permanent forms required for forming the
concrete of the shape, dimensions and surface finish as shown on the drawing or as consented
by the Engineer, together with all props, staging, centering, scaffolding and temporary
construction required for their support. The design, erection and removal of formwork shall
conform to IRC:87 “Guidelines for Design and Erection of Falsework for Road Bridges” and
these specifications. All form work, staging scheme etc. as designed by the Contractor shall be
subject to consent of the Engineer.

Material : All materiais shall comply with the requirements of IRC 87. Forms shall be
constructed with metal or timber. The metal used for forms shall be of such thickness that the
forms remain true to shape. All bolts should be countersunk. The use of approved internal steel
ties or steel or plastic spacers shall be permitted. Structural steel tubes used as support for
forms shall have a minimum wall thickness of 4 mm. Materials and component used for the
formwork shall be examined for damage or deterioration before use / re-use. In case of timber
formwork, the inspection shall also cover signs of attacks by decay, rot or insect attack or
development of splits

Design of Formwork :

(1) The formwork must be designed keeping in view all loads and forces. The Contractor
shall furnish the design and drawing of complete formwork including staging scheme for
consent of the Engineer before any erection is taken up. If proprietary system of
formwork is used, the Contractor shall furnish detailed information to the Engineer as
required by him. Notwithstanding any consent to the design & drawings by the Engineer,
the Contractor shall be entirely responsible for the adequacy and safety for formwork.

(2) The design of the formwork shall conform to provisions of IRC:87. It shall ensure that the
forms can be conveniently removed without disturbing the concrete. The design shall
facilitate proper and safe access to all parts of formwork for inspection. In the case of
prestressed concrete superstructure, careful consideration shall be given to
redistribution of loads on props due to prestressing.

Workmanship :

(1) Formwork shall be so constructed and supported as to remain sufficiently rigid during
the placement and compaction of the concrete and shall be sufficiently watertight to
prevent loss of water or mortar from concrete.

(2) Forms for finished surfaces should be smooth and mortar tight. If wood forms are used,
the boards must be uniform in the thickness, tongued and grooved, smoothly finished on
the surface next to the concrete, evenly matched and tightly placed, except where the

desired surface or appearance requires special treatment. The use of forms of ply-
wood/steel/similar product is also permitted.

Moulds for pretension works shall be sufficiently strong and rigid to withstand, without
distortion, the effects of placing and compacting concrete as well as those prestressing
in case of manufacture by the individual mould process where the prestressing tendon is
supported by the mould before transfer.

The number of joints in the formwork shall be kept to a minimum by using large size
panels. Design shall provide for proper soldiers to facilitate alignment. All joints shall be
leak proof and must be properly sealed. Use of PVC joint sealing tapes, foam rubber or
PVC T-section is essential to prevent leakage

As for as possible, clamps shall be used to hold the forms together. Where use of nails
is unavoidable, minimum number of nails shall be used and these shall be left projecting
so that they can be easily withdrawn. Use of double headed nails shall be preferred.

Use of ties shall be restricted as far as practicable.. Wherever ties are used they shall be
used with HDPE sheathing so that the ties can easily be removed. No parts prone to
corrosion shall be left projecting or near the surface. The sheathing shall be grouted with
cement mortar of the same strength as that of the structure.

Unless otherwise specified, Chamfers or fillets of sizes 25 mm x 25 mm shall be
provided at all angles of the formwork to avoid sharp corners. The chamfers, bevelled
edges and mouldings shall be made in the formwork itself.

Shuttering for walls, sloping members and thin sections of considerable height shall be
provided with temporary openings to permit inspection and cleaning

The formwork shall be constructed with precamber to the soffit to allow for deflection of
the formwork. It shall take due account of the calculated amount of positive or negative
camber so as to ensure the correct final shape of the structures having regard to the
deformation of the false work, scaffolding or propping and the instantaneous or deferred
deformation due to various causes affecting the prestressed structures.

Where centering trusses or launching trusses are adopted for casting of superstructures,
their joints should be thoroughly checked periodically. Also various members of
centering truss should be periodically examined for proper alignment and unintended
deformation & deterioration due to corrosion before proceeding with concreting

Formwork shall be so made so as to produce a finished concrete true to shape, line and
levels and dimensions as shown in the drawings subject to tolerances as specified in
these specifications.

Where metal forms are used, all bolts and rivets shall be countersunk and well ground to
provide a smooth, plane surface. Where timber is used it shall be well seasoned, free
from loose knots, projecting nails, splits or other defects that may mar the surface of
concrete.

Screw jacks or hard wedges where required shall be provided to make up any
settlement before or during placing of concrete.

Special measures in the design of formwork shall be taken to ensure that it does not
hinder the shrinkage of concrete. Soffit of the formwork shall be so designed as to
ensure that the formwork does not restrain the shortening and / hogging of beams
during prestressing.

10.6 Transfer of Pre-stressing Force

(1)

(2)

(3)

(4)

(5)

Transfer of pre-stress shall be carried out gradually so as to avoid large differences of
tension between wires in a tendon, severe eccentricities of pre-stressing force and
sudden application of stress to the concrete. Under no circumstances shall tendons be
cut while under tension.

Where the total pre-stressing force in a member is built up by successive transfers to the
force of a number of individual tendons on to the concrete, account shall be taken of the
effect of the successive pre-stressing.

In the long line and similar methods of pre-stressing, when the transfer is made on
several moulds at a time, care shall be taken to ensure that the pre-stressing force is
evenly applied on all the moulds, and that the transfer of pre-stress to the concrete is
uniform along the entire length of the tension line.

In no case, the load is applied to the concrete before it attains the strength specified on
the drawing or as stipulated by the pre-stressing system supplier, whichever is more.
Before commencing tensioning of the pre-stressing steel, all necessary tests of concrete
cubes manufactured of the same concrete and cured under the same conditions should
have been carried out and results should be found satisfactory

Clause 7.2.6.5.3 of IRS Code of Practice for Plain, Reinforced & Prestressed Concrete
for General Bridge Construction shall be followed. The rate of application of load shall
be in accordance with manufacturer's recommended procedure for post tensioning. Slip
must be measured at each end and extension for the total length

The force induced in the prestressing tendon shall be determined by means of gauges
attached to the tensioning apparatus as well as by measuring the extension of the steel
and relating it to stress-strain curve. The variation between the two measurements
should be within 5%. It is essential that both methods are used jointly so that the
inaccuracies to which each is singly susceptible are minimized. Due allowance shall be

made for frictional losses in the tensioning apparatus. If the variation of two
measurements exceeds 5% then

(i) |The cause shall be ascertained
(ii) The cable should be released and re-stressed

(ii) Even then, if the variation does not come within 5% then the cable should be
rejected

After pre-stressing steel has been anchored, the force exerted by the tensioning
equipment shall be decreased gradually and steadily so as to avoid shock to the
prestressing steel or anchorage.

Number of stages of pre-stressing shall be reduced to minimum preferably not more
than 2

data shall be maintained in the format duly consented by the Engineer

Emergency Cables — Besides design requirements, additional cables/strands shall be
symmetrically placed in the structure so as to be capable of generating a pre-stressing
force of about 4% of the total design pre-stressing force in the structure. Only those
cables which are required to make up the deficiency shall be stressed and the remaining
pulled out and the duct holes grouted. This shall be done in consultation with the
designer.

Provision shall be made to cater for an additional pre-stressing forces of 15% of the
design pre-stressing force for easy installation of pre-stressing steel at a later date

Stressed cables shall be grouted immediately after pre-stressing operation is completed

Pre-Tensioning

the maximum tensioning force permitted. Where concrete elements are cast and pre-
stressed individually, the stressing bench or moulds shall be rigid enough to sustain the
reaction of the pre-stressing force without distortion.

Straight Tendons- In the long-line method of pre-tensioning sufficient locator plates shall
be distributed throughout the length of the bed to ensure that the wires or strands are
maintained in their proper position during concreting. Where a number of units are made
in line, they shall be free to slide in the direction of their length and thus permit transfer

Deflected Tendons — Where possible the mechanisms for holding down or holding up
tendons shall ensure that the part in contact with the tendon is free to move in the line of
the tendon so that frictional losses are nullified. If, however, a system is used that
develops a frictional force, this force shall be determined by test and due allowance
made. For single tendons, the deflector in contact with the tendon shall have a radius of
not less than 5 times the tendon diameter for wire or 10 times the tendon diameter for a
strand, and the angle of deflection shall not exceed 15 degrees. The transfer of the pre-
stressing force to the concrete shall be effected in conjunction with the release of hold-
down and hold-up forces as consented by the Engineer.

Sufficient space shall be left in between the ends of concrete elements to permit access
for cutting the strands / wires after transfer. Hold down or deflectors shall be used for
holding or deflecting the tendons in required position.

The tensioning force required to be applied as stated on the drawings shall be the force
remaining in the strands / wires after all strands / wires have been anchored to the
abutments of stressing bed and after the anchorage slip has already taken place. The
tensioning force shall be determined by direct reading of the pressure gauges and by
the measured elongation after slip.

The Contractor shall submit method of tensioning the tendons including the arrangement
and layout of pre-stressing beds and all tendon deflection points to the Engineer for his
consent before manufacture commences. The Contractor shall also submit calculations
showing that the hold downs have been designed and constructed to withstand
concentrated loads resulting from the application of the tensioning force.

The Contractor shal! carry out trial stressing operations to establish the frictional
resistance offered by the hold-downs and the slip during anchoring. Where sheathing of
pre-tensioned tendons is required to prevent bond over a specified length, it shall
consist of plastic tubing or other material consented by the Engineer

10.8.3 Tensioning Procedure

(1)

(2)

(3)

(4)

The tensioning of the wires and strands shall be done not too much in advance of
concreting. Tensioning force shall be applied gradually and uniformly.

In order to remove slack and to lift tendons off the bed floor, an initial force shall be
applied to the tendons, as consented by the Engineer. Allowance shall be made for this
force in calculating the required elongation.

Tendons shall be marked for measurement for elongation after the initial force has been
applied. When required, tendons shall be marked at both ends the jacking end and dead
end of stressing bed and couplers if used so that slip and draw-in may be measured.

Where deflected strands have been specified, the elongation or strain gauge
measurements may be taken at various positions along the tendon to determine the
force in the tendon at those positions.

10.8.4 Transfer of Pre-stress

(1)

(2)

(3)

While the process of tensioning can be accomplished by means of hydraulic jacks, some
positive mechanical means shall be provided to maintain the tension during the entire
period between tensioning of wires / strands and transfer of the pre-stressing force to
the concrete element.

The method of transfer of pre-stress shall be subject to consent of the Engineer.
Tendons and deflection devices shall be released in such a predetermined order that
unacceptable tensile stresses are not induced in the concrete.

Prior to transfer of the force to the units, all tendons shall be tested for tightness. In case
of any loose tendon shall be reported to Engineer who shall whether the units affected

shall be rejected. Tendons shall be released gradually and preferably simultaneously.
Under no circumstances the tendons shall be cut while under tension

(4) On completion of the transfer of pre-stress, the projecting lengths of tendon shall be cut
off flush with the end surface of the unit.

(5) The sequence of transfer of pre-stressing force shall be done strictly as indicated in the
drawings and ensuring that eccentricities of the pre-stressing force in vertical and
horizontal directions of the concrete element is a minimum during the entire sequence.

(6) The maximum slip of any tendon during transfer shall not exceed 3mm at any end of the
concrete element. In case this slip is exceeded, the concrete element in question shall
be rejected.

Protection of Ends

The exposed ends of the tendons and concrete surface within 50 mm of tendons shall be
abraded to provide a clean sound surface. Two coats of an epoxy tar paint suitably formulated
to give a dry film thickness of 80 microns per coat shall then be immediately applied over the
ends of the tendons.

Grouting of Prestressed Tendons

General

The purpose of grouting is to provide permanent protection to the post tensioned steel against
corrosion and to develop bond between the pre-stressing steel and the surrounding structural
concrete. The grout ensures encasement of steel in an alkaline environment for corrosion
protection and by filling the duct space, it prevents water collection and freezing. The grouting
procedure shall be developed by the Contractor and shall be subject to the consent by the
Engineer.

Material

All the materials for grouting Viz. cement, water, admixtures & sand (if required) shall confirm to
the requirements as specified in Clause 7: Materials for Structures of these specifications.
Pozzolana cement shall not be used.

Sand : It is not recommended to use sand for grouting of pre-stressing tendons. In case the
internal diameter of the ducts exceed 150mm, use of sand may be considered. Sand, if used,
shall conform to 1$:383. The weight of sand in the grout shall not be more than 10 percent of
weight of cement, unless proper workability can be ensured by addition of suitable plasticizers.

Admixtures : Acceptable admixtures conforming to IS: 9103 and as specified in Clause 7:
Materials of these Specifications may be used (with the approval of the Engineer) if tests have
shown that their use improves the properties of grout i.e. increasing fluidity, reducing bleeding,
entraining air or expanding the grout. Admixtures must not contain chlorides, nitrates,
sulphides, sulphates or any other products which are likely to damage the steel or grout. When
an expanding agent is used, the total unrestrained expansion should preferably be between 4
to 6%. Aluminum powder as an expanding agent is not recommended for grouting because its
long term effects are not free from doubt.

Grout Opening or Vent

All ducts shall have grout opening at both ends. For this purpose special openings shall be
provided where such openings are not available at end anchorages. For draped (curved)
cables longer than 50m, grout vents or drain holes may be provided at or near the lowest
points. All grout openings or vents should include provisions for preventing grout leakage.

10.9.4

10.9.5

Standard details of fixing couplers, inlets, outlets and air vent to the duct anchorage shall be
followed as recommended by the supplier of the system of pre-stressing. Ducts should be
securely fastened at close intervals.

All unintended holes or openings in the duct must be repaired prior to concrete placing. The
joints of the couplers and the sheathing should be made water proof by use of tape or similar
suitable system capable of giving leak proof joints. Grout openings and vents must be securely
anchored to the duct and either the forms or to reinforcing steel to prevent displacement during
concreting operations due to weight, buoyancy and vibrations.

Duct require very careful handling as, being thin, they are susceptible to leakage due to
damage during transit or storage by tearing / ripping in handling particularly when placed
adjoining to reinforcing steel, by pulling apart of joints while inserting tendons or by accidental
puncturing while drilling for form ties / inserts. Ducts are also liable to damage by rough use of
internal vibrators and sparks from welding being done close by

Equipment

(1) | Grout Agitator — It is essential that the grout is maintained in a homogenous state and of
uniform consistency so that there is no separation of cement. It is therefore necessary
that the grout be continuously agitated by a suitable mixer with a minimum speed of
1000 RPM and travel of discharge not exceeding 15m per second.

(2) Grout Pump — The pump should be positive displacement type and should be capable of
injecting the grout in a continuous operation and not by way of pulses. The grout pump
must be fitted with pressure gauge to enable pressure of injection to be controlled. The
minimum pressure at which grout should be pumped shall be 0.3Mpa and the grout
pump must have a relief arrangement for bypass of the grout in case of build up of
pressure beyond 1 MPa. The capacity of the grout pump should be such as to achieve a
forward speed of grout of around 5 to 10 meters per minute. The slower rates are
preferable as they reduce the possibility of occurrence of voids. If the capacity of the
pump is large, it is usual to grout two or more cables simultaneously through a common
manifold. Use of hand pumps for grouting is not recommended. Use of compressed air
operated equipment for injection is prohibited as it is likely that there will be some air
trapped in the grout..

(3) Water Pump — Before commencement of grouting, a stand by direct feed high pressure
water pump should be available at site for an emergency. In case of any problem in
grouting the ducts, such pump shall immediately be connected to the duct and all grout
flushed by use of high pressure flushing. It is, therefore, necessary to have adequate
storage of clean potable water for operation of the water pump for such emergencies.

(4) Grout Screen — The grouting equipment should contain a screen having a mesh size of
100um (150um if sand is used). Prior to introduction in to the grout pump, the grout
should be passed through such screen. This screen should be easily accessible for
inspection and cleaning.

(5) Connections and Air Vents — Standard details of fixing inlets and air vents to the
sheathing and / or anchorage should be followed as recommended by the specialist
supplier of the system of pre-stressing. In general all connections are to be of the “Quick
Couple” type and at change of diameters, suitable reducers are to be provided.

Properties of the Grout

(1) Water/cement ratio should be as low as possible, consistent with workability and should
not normally exceed 0.45.

(2) Before grouting, the properties of the grout mix should be tested in a laboratory
depending upon the facilities available. Tests should be conducted for each job
periodically.

(3) Compressive Strength : The compressive strength of 100 mm cubes of the grout shall
not be less than 17 N/mm? at 7 days. Cubes shall be cured in a moist atmosphere for
the first 24 hours and subsequently in water. These tests shall be conducted in advance
to ascertain the suitability of the grout mix.

(4) Cement : Cement shall normally be Ordinary Portland Cement and shall be less than
one month old. When used, its temperature shall not exceed 40°C.

Mixing of Grout — Proportions of materials should be based on field trials made on the grout
before commencement of grouting, but subject to the limits specified above. The materials
should be measured by weight.

Water should be added to the mixer first, followed by cement and sand, if used. Admixture if
any, may be added as recommended by the manufacturer.

Mixing time depend upon the type of the mixer but normally be between 2 & 3 minutes.
However mixing should be for such a duration as to obtain uniform and thoroughly blended
grout without excessive temperature increase or loss of expansive properties of the
admixtures.. The grout should be continuously agitated until it is injected.

Once mixed, no water shall be added to the grout to increase its fluidity.
Hand mixing is not permitted
Grouting Operations

(1) Grouting shall be carried out as early as possible but not later than one week of
stressing a tendon. Whenever this stipulation can not be complied with for unavoidable
reasons, adequate temporary protection of steel against corrosion by the methods or
products which will not impair the ultimate adherence of the injected grout and as
approved by the Engineer should be ensured till grouting. Sealing of the anchorage
ends after concreting is considered to be a good practice to prevent ingress of water.
For the structures in the aggressive environment sealing of the anchorage ends is
mandatory and should be as per the method consented by the Engineer.

Note ; Application of some patented water soluble oils for coating of sterel / VPI powder
injections / sending in of frequent intervals have shown some good results. Some of the
methods recommended for sealing of anchorages are to seal the openings with bitumen
impregnated gunny bag or water proof paper or by building a brick pedestal plastered on
all faces enclosing the exposed wires outside the anchorages.

(2) All traces of oil if applied to steel for preventing corrosion should be removed before
grouting.

(3) Ducts shall be flushed with water for cleaning as well as for wetting the surfaces of the
duct walls. Water used for flushing should be of the same quality as used for grouting. It
may, however contain 1 per cent of slaked lime or quick lime. All water should be
drained through the lowest drain pipe or by blowing oil free compressed air through the
duct.

(4) The water in the duct should be blown out with oil free compressed air. Blowing out
water from duct for cables longer than 50m draped up at both ends by compressed air
may not be effective. Outlet / vent provided at or near the lowest point shall be used to
drain out water from duct.

(5) The connection between the nozzle of the injection pipe and duct should be such that air
can not be sucked in.

(6) All outlet points including vent openings should be kept open prior to the
commencement of injection grout.

(7) Before grouting, all air in the pump and hose should be expelled. The suction circuit of
the pump should be airtight.

10.9.8 Injection of Grout

(1)

(2)

)

(4)

(S)
(6)

After mixing, the grout should be kept in continuous movement. Injection of grout must
be continuous and should not be interrupted.

The method of injection should ensure complete filling of the ducts. To verify this, it is
advisable to compare the volume of the space to be filled by injected grout with the
quantity to grout actually. Also, the bypass system as indicated above is essential for
further safety.

Grouting should be commenced initially with a low pressure of injection of upto 0.3
N/mm? increasing it until the grout comes out at the other end. The grout should be
allowed to flow freely from the outer end until consistency of the grout at this end is the
same as that of the grout at the injection end. When the grout flows at the other end, it
should be closed off and built up of the pressure commenced. Full injection pressure at
about 0.5 N/mm’ shall be maintained for at least one minute before closing the injection
pipe. It is a recommended practice to provide a stand pipe at the highest point of the
tendon profile to hold all water displaced by sedimentation or bleeding.

If there is a build up of pressure much in excess of 1 N/mm? without flow of grout coming
at the other end, the grouting operation should be discontinued and the entire duct
flushed with high water pressure.

Grout not used within 30 minutes of mixing should be rejected.

Disconnection is facilitated if a short length of flexible tube connects the duct and
injection pipe. This can be squeezed and cut off after the grout has hardened.

10.9.9 Precautions

(3)

(4)

i)

(6)

(7)

(8)

When the ambient temperature during the day is likely to exceed 40° C, grouting should
be done in the early morning or late evening hours.

When the cables are threaded after concreting, the duct must be temporarily protected
during concreting by inserting a stiff rod or a rigid PVC pipe or any other suitable method
approved by the Engineer.

During concreting, care shall be taken to ensure that the sheathing is not damaged.
Needle vibrators shall be used with extreme care by the experienced staff to ensure the
above requirements.

In case of stage prestressing, cables tensioned in the first stage should not remain un-
grouted till all cables are stressed. It is a good practice while grouting any duct in stage
prestressing, to keep all the remaining ducts filled up with water containing 1 per cent
lime or by running water through such ducts till the grout has set. After grouting the
particular cable, the water in other cables should be drained and removed with
compressed air to prevent corrosion.

Care should be taken to avoid leaks from one duct to another at joints of vthe pre-cast
members
End faces where anchorages are located are vulnerable points of entry of water. They

have to be necessarily protected with an effective barrier. Recesses should be packed
with mortar/concrete and should preferably be painted with water proof paint.

After grouting is completed, the projecting portion of vents should be cut off and the face
protected to prevent corrosion

Before covering the anchorage zone with concreting, suitable epoxy coating shall be
applied over the anchorage and bearing plates. A epoxy coating selected should be
such that proper bonding is achieved between epoxy coating and concrete after filling
the anchorage zone with concrete.

(ix) ESU shall be fitted in position after completion of wearing course. While
completing this part of the wearing course, adequate care shall be taken to
ensure a waterproof joining with the already existing wearing course,

e) Pre-Setting

(i) The main purpose of presetting of the steel inserts at the time of its installation
is to ensure as closely as possible the condition that in the long run at the
mean average annual temperature, the ESU remains at its nominal state.

(ii) | Major factors responsible for changing the longitudinal length of the bridge
superstructure are indicated below :

> Temperature variation from annual mean.
> Changes due to shrinkage of concrete.

> Changes due to elastic shortening and creep of the prestressed bridge
superstructure.

> Deformation of superstructure and substructure, if any.

Resultant changes in expansion gap due to first factor can occur in both
directions from any pre-selected mean position whereas changes due to
creep and shrinkage are unidirectional such that the expansion gap
continuously increases with passage of time.

The steel insert unit of expansion joint can be fixed in any month of the year: As stated
earlier, the expansion gap between bridge superstructure may vary from time to time;
hence the initial fixing distance between fixing points will obviously depend on the month
of installation of steel insert. The c/c distance between stainless steel fixing-of bolts as
indicated in the drawing can be taken as only nominal. The same shall be modified by
presetting depending on :

(i) The difference between the mean temperature of the month of fixing of steel insert
and the annual average temperature.

(ii) The elapsed period between the casting and/or prestressing and fixing of steel insert
for calculating the remnant creep and shrinkage.

Special requirements for installation :

(i) Prior to construction of bridge deck area adjacent lo the joint, the supplier shall
provide detailed working drawings showing the location of all bolts, recesses and
holes necessary for the installation of the joint. Reinforcing bars in superstructure
shail be amended as required to ensure that there will be no interference in the
installation of the joint.

(ji) All bearing surfaces and recesses which are in contact with the joint assembly shall
be checked with a straight edge to ensure flatness of profile.

(iii) No holes shall be drilled for fixing bolts within 7 days of concreting. Holes for the bolts
shall be drilled lo the size and depth shown on the drawings,

(iv) Sections of the jointing making the completed joint shall follow a straight line.

(v) The fixing bolts shall not be placed in a position until at least 4 weeks after stressing
is completed in post-tensioned box or beam and slab structures.

(vi) Prior To placing sections of jointing, contact surfaces shall be cleaned lo remove all
grease, tar, paint, oil, mud or any other foreign material that may affect adhesion of
the sealant.

deformations (if any) shall be determined and intimated to the manufacturer.
Depending upon the temperature at which the joint is likely to be installed, the gap
dimension shall be preset.

Taking the width of gap for movement of the joint into account, the dimensions of the
recess in the decking shall be established in accordance with the drawings or design
data of the manufacturer.The surfaces of the recess shall be thoroughly cleaned and
all dirt and debris removed. The exposed reinforcement shall be suitably adjusted to

permit unobstructed lowering of the joint into the recess.

The recess shall be shuttered in such a way that the dimensions in the joint drawing
are maintained. The formwork shall be tight. .

Immediately prior to placing the joint, the presetting shall be inspected. Should the
actual temperature of the structure be different from the temperature provided for
presetting, correction of the presetting shall be done. After adjustment, the brackets
shall be tightened again,

The joint shall be lowered in a pre-determined position. Following placement of the
joint in the prepared recess, the joint shall be leveled and finally aligned and the
anchor loops on one side of the joint welded to the exposed reinforcement bars of the
structure. Upon completion, the same procedure shall be followed for the other side
of the joint. With the expansion joint finally held at both sides, the auxiliary brackets
shall be released, allowing the joint to lake up the movement of the structure.

High quality concrete shall then be filled into the recess. The packing concrete must
feature low shrinkage and have the same strength as that of the superstructure, but
in any case not less than M 35 grade. Good compaction and careful curing of
concrete is particularly important. After the concrete has cured, the movable
installation brackets still in place shall be removed,

Rolled up neoprene strip seal shall be cut into the required length and inserted
between the edge beams by using a crow bar pushing the bulb of the seal into the
steel grooves of the edge beams. A landing to a bead shall be formed in the
thickened end of the edges of the seal which would force the thickened end against
the steel beam due to wedge effect when the strip seal is buttoned in place.

As soon as the concrete in the recess has become initially set, a sturdy ramp shall be
placed over the joint to protect the exposed steel beams and neoprene seals from
site traffic. Expansion joint shall not be exposed to traffic loading before the
carriageway surfacing is placed.

The carriageway surfacing shall be finished flush with the top of the steel sections.
The actual junction of the surfacing/wearing coat with the steel edge section shall be
formed by a wedge shaped joint with a sealing compound. The horizontal leg of the
edge beam shall be cleaned beforehand. It is particularly important to ensure
thorough and careful compaction of the surfacing in order to prevent any premature
depression forming in it, ‘

(6) Acceptance Test
a) All steel elements shall be finished with corrosion protection system.

b) For neoprene seal, the acceptance test shall conform to the requirements stipulated

in Table 14.5.1 of these Specifications. It shall also be stretch tested. If a

ROLE OF DESIGN TEAM IN CONTRACTOR'S ORGANIZATION
Role of Design Team in Safety, Health and Environment

In this design-build Contract, the Contractor has a design Team in his project
organization and the Design Team’s primary role includes to minimise the risk to
health and safety of those who are going to construct, maintain, clean, repair,
dismantle or demolish the structures and others like adjoining road users/general
public, who might be affected by the work.

General Philosophy

When considering health and safety in the Design Team’s work, they shall be
expected to do what is reasonable at the time the design is prepared. It may be
possible for hazards, which cannot be addressed at the feasibility stage to be looked
at during detailed design. In deciding what is reasonably practicable, the risk to health
and safety produced by a feature of the design has to be weighed against the cost of
excluding the feature. The overall design process does not need to be dominated by a
concern to avoid all risks during the construction phase and maintenance. However, a
judgment has to be made by weighing up one consideration against another so the
cost is counted not just in financial terms, but also those of fitness for purpose,
aesthetics, buildability or environmental impact. By applying these principles, it may be
possible to make decisions at the design stage, which will avoid or reduce risks during
construction work. In many cases, the large number of design considerations will allow
a number of equally valid design solutions. What is important is the approach to the
solutions of design problems. This should involve a proper exercise of judgement,
which takes account of health and safety issues.

Hierarchy of Risk Control

The Design Team shall need, so far as reasonably practicable, to avoid or reduce risks
by applying a series of steps known as the hierarchy of risk control or principles of
prevention and protection. The steps to be adopted shail include but not limited to the

following:

i) consider if the hazard can be prevented from arising so that the risk can be
avoided (e.g., alter the design to avoid the risk);

ii) if this cannot be achieved, the risk should be combated at source (e.g., ensure
the design details of items to be lifted include attachment points for lifting);

iii) failing this, priority should be given to measures to control the risk that will
protect all people;

iv) only as a last resort should measures to control risk by means of personal
protection be assumed (e.g., use of safety hamesses).

Duty to Provide Health and Safety Risks in the Drawing itself

In case of situations where the Design Team has carried out the design work and
concluded that there are risks, which were not reasonably practicable to avoid,
detailed information shall be given about the health and safety risks, which remain.
This information needs to be included with the design to alert others to the risks, which
they cannot reasonably be expected to know. This is essential for the parties who
have to use the design information.

If the Design Team’s basic design assumptions affect health or safety, or health and
safety risks are not obvious from the standard design document, the Design Team
shall provide additional information. The information shall include a broad indication of
the assumptions about the precautions for dealing with the risks. The information will
need to be conveyed in a clear manner; it shall be included on drawings, in written
specifications or outline method statements. The level of detail to be recorded will be
determined by the nature of the hazards involved and the associated level of risk.

Engineer’s Consent

Every structure like scaffold, false work, launching girder, earth retaining structures
etc. shall have its design calculations included in the method statements in addition to
health and safety risks. The Engineer shall examine and communicate his consent as
per the contract conditions.

Any non-standard structures like trestles made up of re-bars or structures which are
very old, corroded, repaired for many times etc. for which no design calculations can
be made accurately from any national standards, shall not be allowed to be used at
sites even for short duration.

CONTRACTOR’s SHE ORGANISATION

Education and Experience

The Contactor shall appoint adequate numbers of the required SHE personnel
keeping in view the General Instruction DFCCIL/SHE/GI/001 as indicated in

Specifications for reference and based upon the statutory requirement and establish
the SHE organisation appropriate to the size and complexity of the project. The
minimum educational qualification and the work experience are also given in the
General Instruction DFCCIL/SHE/GI/002 as indicated in_Afttachment 9 [Reference for

nearby dwellings, schools, hospitals, or premises with similar sensitivity to
noise. Use equipment with effective noise-suppression devices and employ
other noise control measures as to protect the public.

ii) Schedule and conduct operations in a manner that will minimize, to the
greatest extent feasible, the disturbance to the public in areas adjacent to the
construction activities and to occupants of buildings in the vicinity of the
construction activities.

PART Vil: PENALTY AND AWARDS

CHARGES TO BE RECOVERED FROM CONTRACTOR FOR UNSAFE ACT OR
CONDITION

DFCCIL aims to build an image of one of the best safety conscious organization. Any
reportable accident (fatality/injury) results in toss of life and/or property damage but
also damages the reputation of the organization. Most of the accidents are avoidable
and caused preliminary due to contractors negligence. Hence DFCCIL shall recover
the cost of damages from the contractors for every reportable incident (fatality /injury).

In addition every DFCCIL work: site is exposed to public scrutiny as the work is
executed just on the ROW. Any unsafe act/unsafe condition observed by public further
damages DFCCIL reputation. Because of the non-voluntary compliance of contractors
to the condition of contract on SHE and project SHE manual. DFCCIL has introduced
an enforcement system design to influence the contractor’s decision making and risk
management process in favor of compliance rather than non conformance.

The following table indicates the SHE violations (unsafe act/unsafe condition) that will
warrant charges to be recovered from contractors. Penalties shall be applied to the
contractor following repetitive failure to comply with the SHE manual or employer's
direct instructions. Where awarded by the employer penalties shall be deducted from
the contractor’s running bill.

Gratuity

The Contractor shall ensure payment of gratuity to the eligible employees in accordance with the
provisions contained in The Gratuity Act, 1972.

Gratuity is payable to a person on (a) resignation (b) termination on account of death or
disablement due to accident or disease (c) retirement (d) death. Normally, gratuity is payable only
after an employee completes five years of continuous service. In case of death and disablement,

the condition of minimum 5 years’ service is not applicable.

Gratuity is payable @ 15 days salary/wages for every year of completed service. In the last year
of service, if the employee has completed more than 6 months, it will be treated as full year for
purpose of gratuity.
In case of employees paid on monthly salary/wages basis, per day wages should be calculated
by dividing monthly salary by 26 days to arrive at daily wages e.g. if last drawn salary of a person
(basic plus DA) is Rs. 2,600 per month, his salary per day will be Rs. 100 (2,600 divided by 26).
Thus, the employee is entitled to get Rs. 1,500 [15 days multiplied by Rs. 100 daily salary] for
every year of completed service. If he has completed 30 years of service, he is entitled to get
gratuity of Rs. 45,000 (Rs. 1,500 multiplied by 30). Maximum gratuity payable under the Act is Rs.
10 lakhs.
The Contractor shall obtain an insurance from the Life Insurance Corporation of India established
under the Life Insurance Corporation of India Act, 1956 (31 of 1956) or any other prescribed
insurer for his liability for payment towards the gratuity under this Act.

a) Submission of Form No.1 to Deputy Labour Commissioner (Central);

b) Maintenance of Form F Nomination;

c) Arranging for Formation of Trust;

WORK PLACE POLICY

DFCCIL’s WORKPLACE POLICY ON HIV/AIDS PREVENTION & CONTROL FOR WORKERS
ENGAGED BY CONTRACTORS

1.0

2.1

4.0

Background and Rationale

DFCCIL recognizes that the continuing spread of HIV/AIDS constitutes a serious obstacle to the
process of development and realizes that there is a need to have coordinated and sustained
response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic.

DFCCIL recognizes that access to medication in the context of pandemics such as HIV/AIDS is
one of the fundamental elements necessary to achieve progressively the full realisation of the
right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental
health.

DFCCIL recognizes that care, support and treatment can contribute to effective prevention
through increased acceptance of voluntary and confidential counseling and testing, and by
keeping people living with HIV/AIDS and vulnerable groups in close contact with health-care
systems and facilitating their access to information, counseling and preventative supplies.
DFCCIL recognizes that effective prevention, care and treatment strategies will require behavioral
changes and increased availability of and non-discriminatory access to, inter alia, vaccines,
condoms, microbiocides, sterile injecting equipment, drugs including anti-retroviral therapy,
diagnostics and related technologies as well as increased research and development,

General
The transmission of the Human Immuno-deficiency Virus (HIV) is through:
e Unprotected sexual contact with an infected person;
e Transfusion of infected blood or blood products;
e Sharing of infected needles or syringes; and
e From infected mother-to-child during pregnancy, childbirth or breast feeding.

There is no scientific or epidemiological evidence to suggest that HIV can be transmitted through
ordinary workplace contact (talking to or touching the person, using the same office equipment,
tools, utensils or bathroom). Transmission is therefore not likely in the regular workplace setting.

People with HIV may remain healthy and fit to work for several years despite their infection.

With the availability of Anti Retroviral Treatment, the life of people living with HIV can be
prolonged substantially and they can lead a normal productive life.

Aim
The policy aims to:
* Prevent transmission of HIV infection amongst workers engaged by the Contractor
including those of his subcontractors and consultants and their families;

e Pravide access to care, support and treatment to those who are infected;
e Protect workers from stigma and discrimination related to HIV/AIDS by assuring them
equity and dignity at the workplace;

Scope
This policy applies to all contractors, subcontractors, consultants and their employees (including
applicants applying them for work) in the work sites, office locations, accommodation camps, all

work location and their spouse and children or other family members, residing with the worker.

Guiding Principles

The policy adopts the key principles of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) ‘Code of

f) Allow an HIV positive employee to continue to work in his or her job unless medical
conditions interfere with the job requirement. On health grounds, the employee may be
shifted to another job for which he is medically fit;

g) Ensure continued employment and benefits to people living with HIV (PLHIV);

h) Ensure that the co—employees do not shun their HIV positive peer or refuse to work
alongside them;

i) Not discriminate against any employee infected by HIV/AIDS with regard to promotions,
training and any other privileges, applicable to all employees of his organisation;

j) Not ask any person who is being offered a job to undergo HIV/AIDS prevalence test,
without an informed consent and pre-test counselling of the candidate, as a part of
general medical examination before the issue of the appointment letter, or otherwise;

k) Educate its employees and encourage them to participate in voluntary counseling and
testing of HIV/AIDS. However, HIV/AIDS tests shall not be a part of any annual or regular
health check ups, without the employee's informed consent and pre test counseling.

!) Ensure that proper treatment is available to employees infected with HIV/AIDS and
prescribe a reasonable limit on expenditure in meeting the cost of anti-retroviral (ARV)
drugs. All other costs related to treatment of HIV/AIDS (non-ARV) shall be borne by the
Contractor.
