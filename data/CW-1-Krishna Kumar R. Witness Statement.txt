When I joined L&T, I worked with and reported to Mr. V.N. Gokhale
("VNG"), the then Project Director, CTP 1&2. In the year 2014, Mr
Sanjeev Gupta joined CTP 1&2 as Project Director in place of VNG and
since then, I have been reporting to Mr. Sanjeev Gupta. Upon
substantial completion of the Contract and transfer of Mr. Sanjeev
Gupta, I am reporting to Mr. S. Ramkumar, (Executive Vice president

There are around 5 employees who are working under me at TEL.

Some of my main duties are to coordinate issuance of day to day
contractual correspondences of CIP 1&2 including notices,
documents, correspondences with Engineer/ Employer, claim for
Extension of Time, Costs, Variations etc. and representation of

disputes before the Dispute Adjudication Board.

The present proceedings pertain to the Civil and Track package
between Rewari-Iqbalgarh section of Western Dedicated Freight

Corridor for a total length of 626 kms. (hereinafter referred to as “the

Project”).

At the time of my joining L&T in November 2013, SLT had already

Further, when I joined L&T in November 2013, SLT had also submitted
to DFCCIL (in September 2013) the time programme which included
the order, sequence and timing of construction which SLT intended to
follow, while carrying out the Works and which was pending with the

Engineer designate DFCCIL for approval.

24. MS-3 is the completion of Track skeleton for the entire package, which
inter alia include the track skeleton of MS-1 i.e., from Bhagega - Rewari.
The time for completion of MS-1 and MS-3 has been extended due to
various Respondent delay events, thereby entitling Claimant to

additional cost.

25. I state that the additional cost incurred by Claimant in the extended

period of MS-1 i.e., Civil and Track skeleton work from Bhagega to


Rewari is dealt as a separate dispute. This proceeding is for the
additional cost incurred for execution of the MS-3 works in the section
from Bhagega - Iqbalgarh (less Technical Design) in the extended
period of MS-3 i.e., 10 February 2017 to 30 June 2018.

Il. SCOPE OF WORK OF MS-3

26. The scope of work involved laying 1372.2 kms of track, upon
completion of formation works of 648.6 kms (Section length) which
includes completion of 648.6 Km of Earthwork and 1289 structures
(including Variation to scope of work as on 31 August 2016). The

28. One of the key and critical activities of the Project is track work to be
; undertaken by mechanical means as per Contract. The Project
2 ° ‘envisaged 632.87 TKms. and 739.36 TKms of track linking in CTP-1 and

P-2 respectively- to be undertaken with New Track Construction

29. NTC operates in forward linear direction and can move only on

developed formation. Hence, for NTC to lay track, formation

comprising Earthwork, Major and Minor structures completed to up

to the formation level in contiguity is a pre-requisite. Therefore prior

to laying the track using NTC, the front had to be developed vertically

up to the formation level in continuity. A sketch depicting the different


components of formation works inter alia earthwork, minor and major

structure up to required levels is set out hereinbelow:

“ON. No, 19;

By letter dated 23 May 2014, the time programme submitted by the
Claimant on 05 December 2013 was accepted without any objections
by the Engineer (appointed only on 23 April 2014) as the CCP, i.e. the
programme which supersedes all other programmes submitted earlier

and shall be deemed to be the programme on which the Claimant has

11


i

based his Accepted Contract Amount as well as in accordance with
which the Claimant shall execute the Works within the specified Time
for Completion. Copy of letter dated 23 May 2014 of the Engineer
giving its approval to the detailed time programme submitted by the
Claimant is filed at page 3557-3558 in Vol CD-15 and exhibited as
Exhibit C-7. The time programme was approved as CCP without any

objection by the Respondent or the Engineer.
B. Execution of the Works:

34. The Claimant had in its time programme, which was approved as CCP,
divided the entire route length into following four packages- Package
A, B, C and D. Each of the packages was further divided into sections.
The Claimant has tabulated the section wise details as set out in the
CCP and the Contract (Attachment 1A) along with DFCCIL and IR
chainages and the same is filed at page 3559-3560 in Vol CD-15 and

each of the packages is filed at page 3565 in Vol CD-15 and exhibited

as Exhibit C-10.

35. In the time programme approved as Contractual Construction

Programme, the following were considered:
a) Only one NTC is required for track work.

b) CTP-1 Package: All the facilities related to track work to be at

Bhagega including connection with Indian Railways.

(<f, 7
tS

12


f)

Accordingly for the completion of Track Skeleton in CTP-1, the
track laying was planned from Bhagega to Rewari and after
completing Bhagega to Rewari, the track laying was planned
from Bhagega to Madar.

CTP-2: All the facilities related to track work of CTP-2 was to be
at Marwar including connection with Indian Railways to
commence track skeleton of CTP2 after completing the track
skeleton for CTP1. Accordingly, for the completion of track
skeleton of CTP-2, the track laying from Marwar to Iqbalgargh
was planned from the depot at Marwar with the NTC deployed
in CTP-1, but after completion of track skeleton of CTP-1.

Track skeleton of a section will commence only after the
formation of that section comprising Earth work, Major and
Minor structures is completed or else the date of completion of

the formation is linked to arrival of NTC at the relevant location

Program also considered the formation comprising Earthwork,
Minor and Major bridges will be completed in the same sequence
of track skeleton work so that the track skeleton work is not

delayed / disrupted.

Pursuant to the above, there exists a differing time cycle for the

completion of earthwork and structures in various sections.

Major and Minor structures are to be completed ahead of

completion of Earth work.

13

36.

h)

i)

k)

Earth work, Major and Minor structures of sections will be
progressed concurrently to complete the formation of the
sections prior to commencement of Track Skeleton of the

relevant section.

No splitting of work (Major Bridges, RUB etc.) is envisaged in

the programme/Contract.

ROB in a section will be completed after completion of the track

skeleton of that section.

Post Track Installation and Additional Track Surfacing has been

considered in MS-4; and

The interface contractor will commence and complete the work
as per Coordination Event and Key Milestones (ATB 8.2). A copy
of analysis of timelines as per Coordination Events for
Interfacing Contractors has been filed at page 1 in Vol CD-337
and exhibited as Exhibit C-121.

The Employer had split the whole Work into 2 packages for better

administrative control. However, CCP divided the entire Project (CTP

1&2) into 23 sub sections. CCP do not provide completion of CTP-1

and 2 as separate milestones. CCP provides programme for the

achievement of milestones.

14


37.

38.

39.

For MS-3, the Claimant had planned the execution of track skeleton in
following sequence:

1) — Bhagega to Rewari,

2) Bhagega to Madar,

3) Marwar to Madar, and

4) — Marwar to Iqbalgarh.

Planned sequence of track works as per CCP is filed at page 3566 in
Vol CD-15 and exhibited as Exhibit C-11.

CCP reckoned only 1 NTC and it was considered that track skeleton
can progress in sequence to complete MS-1 by 05 August 2015 (in CTP-
1) and MS-3 by 09 February 2017 (completing CTP-1 portion first). MS-
1 is the priority section having knock-on impact on track skeleton of
whole work (MS-3). Therefore, insofar as completion of MS-3 in

concerned, completion of MS1 is key and critical activity.

The sequence of construction in CCP would reveal that track skeleton
of CTP-1 will be completed first and NTC will move to Marwar over
IR track to carry out the track skeleton of Madar - Iqbalgarh (CTP-2).
As the NTC was engaged in CTP-1 on 31 August 2016, due to the
Employer delays time for completion of CTP-2 had been impacted pro-
rata.As set out hereinbefore, any delay to completion of Track Skelton

works in the first section i.e., Bhagega to Dabla will have a knock-on

impact on completion of MS-3.

42.

Mobilisation of resources for execution

In accordance with CCP, the Claimant (after obtaining the consent/
approval of the Respondent and/or Engineer and/or IR, wherever
required) established temporary rail connectivity at Bhagega,
mobilized NTC at Bhagega, imported rail from Japan to Bhagega
through rail from Mundra port, established rail welding yard and
sleeper plant at Bhagega and submitted design and drawings relevant
to section Bhagega-Dabla on priority seeking the consent of the
Engineer / Engineer designate to commence the work in the said
section. This was as per the planned sequence of work to be followed
by the Parties to ensure smooth completion of works within the CCP

timelines.

As per CCP, the track skeleton of CTP-1 shall commence on 02 January
2015 to complete the same by 22 February 2016. 632.87 T Km of track
work requiring 10,50,566 number of sleepers was to be completed in
596 days. Therefore, it was planned that sleeper plant at Bhagega will
be commissioned by 31 May 2014

CCP envisaged that the track skeleton could be progressed unhindered
to complete that of CTP-1 by 22 February 2016. Thereafter, the track
skeleton work from Marwar could be commenced on 23 February 2016
and the track skeleton of CTP-2 could be completed on 06 February
2017 (i.e., 739.39 TKm of track skeleton requiring 12,27,336 number of
sleepers will be completed in 834 days). It was accordingly planned

that sleeper plant be established at Marwar on 26 August 2014.

as Exhibit C-126.

V. DELAY EVENT AND BREACHES BY THE RESPONDENT:

45. Execution of work under the Contract could neither commence nor

progress as per CCP due to various delay events/breaches by the

Respondent (“Delay Events”) set out in paragraphs below.

46. Following are the major Clause 8.4 Delay Events which delayed the
7 ~~.completion of MS-3, when status as on 31 August 2016 was considered:

of minor minerals having an area less than 5 ha and stay on the

process of EC (as per Office Memorandum dated 24 December

2013) by Hon’ble National Green Tribunal (“NGT”).

c) Delay caused to construction of Road Under Bridge (“RUB”)
due to variations in the ER and reasons attributable to the

Respondent.

d) Non handing over of unencumbered possession of land/Right

of Way within such periods stated in the Contract.

e) Delay in shifting of Chartered utilities due to Authority delays

which are beyond the control of Claimant.

f) Delay caused to the work due to paucity of cash Flow.

g) Delay in completion of track skeleton work due to the delayed
completion of MS-1 and discontinuity of the developed sections

of MS-3 due to various Cl. 8.4 delay events.

47. Each of the aforesaid Delay Events along with correspondences have
been set out in the Claimant's claim for EOT. The same has been set

out in brief hereinbelow:

i. Engineer's consent/ Notice of No Objection to Contractor’s design
documents was delayed beyond the review periods stated in the
Contract.

48. As per the Contract, an Engineer was mandated to be appointed by the

{ Reon. No 197

49. After the Commencement Date of the Contract the Employer notified
the Claimant vide letter dated 01 October 2013 that the Employer’s
Chief Project Manager’s (Engineer (Designated)) would act as the
Engineer as the appointment of a ’...Project Management Consultancy is

likely to take more time’.

50. However, the Respondent/Employer did not have the suitably

qualified personnel and resources to the extent required for
performance of the duties of the Engineer as per the provisions of the
Contract including for the time bound review of the Claimant's

Documents, which in turn delayed the approval of Technical Design.

51. The Respondent's appointment of ‘the Engineer’ was notified (after
236 days of Commencement Date/approximately 8 months) to the
Claimant on 23 April 2014. i.e., when about 90% of time envisaged for
Technical Design had already elapsed. Completion of Technical
Design within such periods was inevitable to attain the intermediate

beyond the contractual review period of 21 days.

The Engineer’s comments following the review was also issued

piecemeal and spread over a very long period of time.

Several additions to the ER were made necessitating additional
compliances/ modifications to the original design formulated as
per ER. Details of the said additions were set out in the

Claimant’s claim for Extension of Time.

Enormous delay by Indian Railways (“IR”)/other relevant
authorities in approving Claimant’s design documents/
General Arrangement Design (“GAD”) as recommended by the

Engineer (after its review). Further, IR and State authorities have

Contract/ ER and as recommended by the Engineer, after its

review.

55. Claimant notified the Engineer/ Respondent of these delay events at

the relevant time and sought appropriate and reasonable actions to

arrest such delay events. However, these delay events continued for a

20


very long period, delaying the planned execution of works as per CCP.
The aforesaid delay events impacted delay to the Time for Completion
of Milestones and whole work and attracted provisions of Clause 8.4
(e) of GCC. Claimant had to seek Extension of Time for Completion of

whole work/ Milestones.

59. Following delay events are relevant in this regard.

a) _ As per the terms of the Contract, Span arrangement / Technical

design of RUB was not requiring approval of IR and hence, there

21


was no requirement of coordination with IR for the approval of
Claimant's design. It was only on 05 November 2014, based on
the Respondent’s discussion with IR, the requirement of IR’s
approval of GAD showing integrated arrangements of RUB on
IR and DFCCIL track to be prepared by Claimant, prior to
construction of RUB was ordered as a Variation to the Contract.
It was only Respondent who had attended meetings and
coordinated with the LR. and the Road authorities for the
approval of design of RUBs. The approval of the IGAD of RUB
was delayed by IR

b) Contract requires the GAD/ span arrangement of the MJB shall
be approved by IR prior to the Engineer issuing NONO to the
design documents. Technical design of MJB shall commence
only after NONO to the span arrangement is issued. The
Engineer /Respondent however required the Engineer’s
consent / NONO to GAD prior to seeking consent/ approval of

span arrangement by IR.

and 10 March 2014, Respondent had, inter alia, directed the

Claimant that "since no alignment drawing has been approved by the

22

employer, due to which, approval of GADs of bridges will not be
possible". Claimant was, therefore, requested "to concentrate on
alignment design and its approval. Once the same is finalized further
action will be taken regarding approval of GAD of bridges". Copies of
letters dated 21 February 2014 and 10 March 2014 are filed at
74430 and 74431 of Volume CD-477 and exhibited as Exhibit C-
181 and Exhibit C-182 respectively. This was a Varied

requirement as not supported by the terms of Contract.

ii. Change in Law (in_the State of Rajasthan) requirin rior
environmental clearance by the State to issue lease for mining of minor
minerals having an area less than 5 ha and delay in granting EC due
to various Authority delays:

60. Project inter alia requires procurement and consumption of large

quantum of minor minerals such as:

concrete, ballast, and blanketing.

61. Claimant was required to bid duly reckoning the rates and prices of
inputs as per the law in force on the Base Date i.e. 28 days prior to the
last date for submission of the tender. Approximately 85% of the entire

works (gross) fell within the State of Rajasthan.

62. On19June 2012, State of Rajasthan had amended the Rajasthan Minor
Mineral Concession Rules, 1986 which provided that the
environmental clearance (“EC”) for mining would be fulfilled by the

approval of Environmental Management Plan of cluster of mines by

fRoBERS
Hf? an \


the District level appraisal committee. The said legislation was in force
in the State of Rajasthan on the Base Date of the Contract, ie., 21
January 2013.

63. As per the Law in force in the State of Rajasthan on Base Date, approval
for extraction of the minor minerals from mines having an area less
than 5 ha was to be obtained from the State Government within a
reasonable time. Accordingly, Claimant had formulated and
submitted its Bid on 19 February 2013. The Respondent
unconditionally accepted Claimant's bid and Contract was entered in

to accordingly.

64. However, subsequent to the Base Date, the following events occurred:

(i) | Change in Legislation requiring EC prior to the State issuing

lease for mining of minor minerals: Vide Gazette notification

dated 9 September 2013, the Ministry of Environment and
Forest (“MOEF”) amended Environment Impact Assessment

notification 2006. The said amendment mandated inter alia

2013.

(ii) | Further, on 24 December 2013, MOEF issued guidelines by way
of Office Memorandum (“OM”) for categorizing projects
under category B in to B1 and B2 (a requisite for issuing EC).
Mining of ordinary earth and stone/aggregate for which EC

was sought by Claimant was under Category B2. On 8 January

24

(iii)

(iv)

2014, the State of Rajasthan implemented OM dated 24
December 2013 and State Environment Impact Assessment

Authority (“SEIAA”) was directed accordingly.

Additional time beyond what was envisaged in the Contract
was required for the submission of application for EC to SEIAA
as per the OMs. Appraisal of Claimant's application for EC was
delayed by SEIAA/ SEAC and the same was pending
consideration of SEIAA in the month of June 2014 when the

process was stayed by NGT.

Stay by the Hon'ble National Green Tribunal on the process of
grant of EC also as per OM dated 24 December 2013.By order
dated 28 March 2014 and 6 June 2014, the Hon’ble National
Green Tribunal passed in OA No. 123 of 2014 (Himmat Singh

Shekhawat and Ors. Vs. State of Rajasthan & Ors.), staying the
process of grant of EC in the State of Rajasthan even as per OM
dated 24 December 2013. This in turn delayed commencement
and progress of the work of various sections. As directed by the
Engineer /Employer, Claimant approached the Hon’ble NGT
for inter alia vacation of stay. It was on 13 January 2015, the
Hon’ble NGT vacated the stay and pronounced that SEIAA
shall consider the applications filed by Claimant seeking EC, in

accordance with law and other observations made in the

Judgment expeditiously and in any case within a period of

three months from 13 January 2015.

In the meantime, on 26 November 2014, the State of Rajasthan

amended mining rules, as per which excavation of earth up to

25


1.5 m for filling did not fall under mining. As per amended rule,
no EC was required for the extraction of earth from borrow pit
up to a depth of 1.5 m for use in embankment. Since 15
December 2014, Claimant commenced embankment after
obtaining approvals from the State as per the amended mining

rules.

65. Due to the aforesaid events which attracted inter alia Clause 13.7 and
8.4 of GCC and PC, the Claimant could not commence work till the

approval for the mining of earth and stones is obtained.

66. Consequently, there was delay in commencement of time-consuming
activities of embankment, sub grade, blanket, ballast and Structures

etc. with resultant time and cost overrun of MS-3.

Sor OY oo |
~......68:" The Engineer considered this delay event as the dominant led to delay
in completion of MS-3 when status as on 31 August 2016 and
accordingly made its determination.

69. I have explained hereinbelow the effect of the aforesaid event
impacted the earthwork in filling and prevented Claimant from
meeting the requirement of earthwork in filling from cutting.

a) I state that cutting contributes only 13% of total earthwork and
is spread across the whole Contract (648Km). Requirement of
SO

26


b)

progress in earthwork was to complete it in such sequence so
that Track linking sequence is met with. No such plan could be
evolved by Claimant for carrying out the earth work in cutting
in all sections when the earthwork in filling (87%) was delayed
by the Change in Law requiring prior EC and stay by Hon’ble
National Green Tribunal, to mitigate the delay caused to the
earth work in filling. Claimant undertook the earthwork in
cutting to the extent practical, as is evident from the assessment

of EOT.

As per Engineer’s determined EOT (as on 31 August 2016) [Page
8567 to 8673 in Volume CD-25, Exhibit C-16], the total quantity
of cutting is 47,95,739 Cum whereas the total quantity of filling

(Embankment and Subgrade) is 310,92,247 Cum i.e., quantity of
cutting is 15.42% of earth work in filling.

47,95,739 Cum of cutting is cumulative of the cutting at isolated
stretches spread across the whole contract. In this regard, a
statement compiled from the Engineer’s assessment of EOT is

attached herewith and marked as Exhibit CW-1/4.

As per CCP, Earthwork of various sections was to be completed
in sequence to meet Track linking sequence. This could not have
been accomplished only with spoil from cutting at isolated
sections used in the embankment at economical lead, as its

contribution was only 15.42 % of the total filling.

Earthwork in filling could have been completed only if earth

obtained from borrow pit is allowed as its requirement in the

27


total mix was 84.58% (predominant), even if whole cut spoil is
used for embankment. Earth work in filling from borrow pit in
the Rajasthan sector was held up since 09 September 2013 due
to Change in Law and subsequent Stay by NGT. Progress in
cutting (even if 100% cutting is used as spoil) would not have
met the objective of completing the earthwork in formation in

continuity as required for track skeleton.

f) By way of example, in the case of the priority section Bhagega -
Dabla, the total quantity of filling (Embankment and Subgrade)
is 18,81,600 cum whereas the quantity of cutting is 5,08,800 cum
in 39 strips. Even if it is reckoned that 100 % of cut fill in this
section can be used for Embankment, the objective of
completing the Formation in continuity, a requisite for track

linking could not have been achieved.

g) I state that SLT had been undertaking cutting to the extent
practical. As per the Engineer’s assessment of EOT, as on
December 2014 i.e., when stay by NGT was vacated, the

progress of cutting in the priority section was 1,68,644 cum

/ o£ ‘Eo » which was approx. 33% of cutting envisaged in the section. This

*\ progress was notwithstanding the encumbrances, hold up in
; | embankment formation due to structure gaps and other delay

events in EOT.

h) A perusal of the final quantum of work undertaken would
reveal that 100 % of the cut fill was not used in the work as some

of the cut spoil was not meeting the requirement of earth fill; the

28


iii.

70.

cutting include various types of soil, such as ordinary soil, soft

rock, hard rock etc.

Material from Cutting (15.42%) was not sufficient to even meet
the requirement of earth work in embankment and subgrade,
therefore stacking the cut fill material for use as blanket material

on a future date was not in the planning.

Besides the above, as per the Employers Requirement and
Specification of Blanket layer in the Contract supplemented by
addendum 4 dated 04 December 2012, Sl.no 7 and Specification
Clause 5.2.1 (9), 5.9.2 and 5.9.3 etc., cut material cannot be

directly used as blanket material.

Delay caused to construction of Road Under Bridge (“RUB”) due to

reasons beyond Claimant's control and responsibility

The Claimant is required to design and construct RUB on DFCC’s

track. A total of 304 RUBs are envisaged in this Contract. The Bidding

documents set out the details of RUB to be constructed:

Contract sets out whether each RUB is to interface with an IR RUB or
not along with details of the structural configuration for each RUB both
for the IR and DFC tracks. As such, it is evident that 40 RUBs have no

interface, whereas 265 RUBs have an interface with an IR RUB.

Clause 3 of the Employer's Requirements [Design] _ titled
‘Requirements During Design Phase’ and Sub-Clause 3.1(2) sets out
the requirements in respect of ‘Span Arrangement of Important /

Major Bridges’. The Sub-Clause states that IR’s approval to the span

\NONO is issued by the Engineer to the Claimant and that this
pproval will be arranged by the Respondent. This is further
copfirmed i in Sub-Clause 6.3 of the Employer’s Requirements [Design]

ich is titled “Co-ordination with Indian Railways’

Thus, the design of the other categories of bridges, including RUB,

does not required approval of IR.

RUB on IR track [which is conjoint with that on the DFCC’s track] were

to be constructed by IR. Topography, formation levels and positioning

of RUBs at Level Crossing (“LC”) with heavy traffic through it etc.


75.

76.

77.

required RUB on IR track to be constructed ahead of the RUB on
DFCC’s track.

In the CCP, no delay by IR and consequent unhindered execution of
RUB on DFCC track was envisaged. It was reckoned that RUB on IR
track will be completed by IR ahead of the commencement date of
RUBs on DFCC track (as envisaged in CCP). Claimant could thus
progress RUBs on DFCC track unhindered and without delay.

On 5 November 2014, a Variation was issued whereby, the Claimant
was instructed as follows:

i) The construction of RUBs/LHS requires connection with
existing/proposed RUB/LHS of IR. Moreover these RUBs/LHS must
have proper road approaches and connections with adjoining roads.

ii) As such with reference to MOM held on 14.10.2014 between NWR
and DFCCIL and DFCCIL letter No. JP/EN/SLT/LC-ROB-RUB/6
Dt. 04.11.2014, the GADs for proposed RUBs/LHS under DFCCIL
alignment requires approval of NWR. It is therefore requested that
GADs indicating integrated arrangements (giving details of both
NWR & DFCCIL Boxes) should be submitted to CMT office for
approval of DFCCIL & NWR.

iii) The GADs should have format similar to Major bridges drawing for
getting signature of DFCCIL & NWR authorities.

Claimant had no role/ authority to interface with IR to resolve / decide

on issues which are touching and concerning design and construction

of work involving IR. In this regard, I state the following:

a) Claimant was not a party to the additional requirement of IR’s

31


78.

79.

80.

commencement of RUB on DFCC track. DFCC was a party to the

agreement.

b) This additional requirement was notified by the Respondent to
the Engineer, and Claimant was directed by the Engineer to

comply with the requirement in accordance with CL 3.3.

c) Claimant's request to avoid this additional requirement was not

acceded to. [Vol CD 18- Exhibit C-13; Page 5448-5451]

On 29 May 2015, Claimant was allowed to cast RUB boxes at its risk
and cost, pending approval of IGAD. Copy of letter dated 29 May 2015
of Engineer is filed at page 12907-12912 of Volume CD-358 and
exhibited as Exhibit C-164.

In February 2016, the Respondent decided that RUB can commence as
per the token approval of IGAD by the Respondent, as approval of
IGAD by IR was taking considerable time.

The Design as per ER is part of the scope of work and, therefore, any
change to the Design process from ER constitutes a Variation under
the Contract. This has already been acknowledged by the Engineer in
an assessment dated 15 May 2015 in respect of Claimant’s claim for

extension of time for MS-1. Copy of EOT Determination dated 15 May

©2015 of the Engineer for MS- 1 (for delay events upto 31 January 2015)

has been filed at page 74432-74478 in Vol CD-477 and is exhibited as

by the Employer vide letter dated 17 September 2015. Copy of letter
dated 17 September 2015 is filed at page 74547 in Vol CD-477 and
exhibited as Exhibit C- 185.

The contemporaneous records evidence that pursuant to design
submissions after incorporating the new requirement of IGAD
approval to the Engineer, the Claimant had no direct role in the
approval process. It was the Respondent which conducted all meetings
for obtaining IGAD approval with the IR, to the exclusion of Claimant
or else the delay in approval of the IGAD was Respondent's delays.
Claimant notified the Engineer about such Respondent's delays and
the same would evidence that the Claimant had not committed any

default.

Further to above, Claimant could not commence construction of
number of RUBS due to non-construction by IR the RUB on the IR side.
100 % completion of RUB in one go as planned in the CCP was affected
by unavailability of land for the approach road_ inter alia retaining

wall, road work etc.,

Pursuant to above Claimant was constrained to complete RUB in part/
burial of RUB boxes as a mitigation measure at locations where IR
could not construct RUBs. This measure was adopted whereby part of
the RUB was completed to facilitate track skeleton by moving NTC
over such part completed RUB to avoid idling of NI'C/ track resources.

The Variation ordered by the Respondent dated 05 November
2014 requiring IR’s approval to the IGAD prior to
commencement of construction of RUB led to immense delay in
Engineer’s consent/NONO to Claimant's design documents.
The Claimant's design submissions for the RUBs made up to
November 2014 since commencement required resubmissions
due to the aforesaid requirements leading to delay in

commencement of RUBs.

Construction of RUB on DFCC track was withheld due to non-
completion by IR RUB on IR track, which is conjoint with that

on DFCC track and non-finalisation of location of RUB.
Encumbrances preventing 100% completion of RUB.

approach road to RUBs was inadequate. Approach road to each
of the RUBs was to be constructed as per the specifications of
Indian Road Congress (“IRC”) for which required land was to
be provided by the Respondent and the land acquired by the
Respondent and handed over to Claimant for construction of

approach road was inadequate.

e) 11 RUBs [7(under DFCC track) and 4 (under IR track)] were
added to Contract from commencement up to 31 August 2016.
Approved GAD of 41 RUBs were in variance with that

provided in the Contract.

Due to the aforesaid events, the Time for Completion of MS-3 required

extension.

Non-hand over of unencumbered possession of land and Right of way

within the contractual period:

Under the Contract, the Respondent is required to hand over
possession of unencumbered Right of Way (“ROW”). However, the
Respondent could not fulfil the obligation of handing over the ROW
in MS-3 as per the CCP.

As per the sequence and priority of works planned in the CCP,
unencumbered ROW from Bhagega to. Rewari and Bhagega to Biroliya

was to be handed: over to. the. Claimant within 28 days of

182 days of commencement. (i.e. on 28 February 2014).

Handing over of unencumbered possession of land was delayed and
to this effect, inter alia the following is relevant:
a) Handing over of unencumbered ROW was done piecemeal and

over a period time.

b) | Even the ROW handed over in MS-3 till 31 August 2016 was
not encumbrance free but was hindered by trees, buildings,
OFC cables, electric poles, water pipelines etc. The removal of

these hindrances was the Respondent's obligation.

c) Execution of work at some locations was also hindered by
locals alleging non-payment of compensation by the

Respondent.

As on 31 August 2016, the Claimant had completed/was progressing
Earthwork in 515.096 km length in the total alignment. As per
Claimant's EOT application dated 28 November 2016, as on 31 August
2016, 40.435 kms of section [36.035Km of obstruction and 4.4 Km non-
handing over of land in Madar- Saradhana] in 414 patches was
unavailable for construction. Further, the Respondent did not handed

Delay to shifting of charted and unchartered utilities due to reasons
beyond the control of Claimant:

Shifting/ diverting of charted electrical utilities of capacity less than 33
KV is within the scope of the Claimant. Claimant was also under the
obligation to shift/ divert uncharted utilities (if any) confronted during

the execution of work, as a variation to the Contract.

Shifting/ diverting of Charted Utilities could not be commenced and
progressed as per the CCP due to reasons not attributable to Claimant.
Events which delayed shifting/ diversion of Charted utilities inter alia
includes (a) delay in the Engineer’s consent/ NONO to utilities to be
shifted (b) Authority delay in consenting the utilities to be shifted (c)
delay by the relevant Authority in raising debit note for shifting the
Chartered utility etc.

Shifting of 6 Overhead and 23 Underground Chartered utilities in MS-
3 could not be commenced even on 31 August 2016, pending approval
by the relevant authorities (work in 1.45 kms length in MS-3 in 29
patches from Rewari to Kishangarh excluding Pacharmalikpur to

Phulera) was held up due to above delay event.

During actual execution of work, the Claimant was confronted with
some utilities which were not under the scope of the Contract
(Uncharted utilities). The Claimant was instructed to shift/divert the

uncharted utilities as a Variation to the Contract.

This varied work, however, could not be commenced due to the delay

in finalization of Variation order by. the Respondent/ Engineer.

96. Shifting/ diverting of 16 OH and 10 UG Uncharted utilities was under
hold on 31 August 2016 due to this reason. This is turn, delayed the
work of section totaling to 1.35 km in MS-3.

97. The Claimant, while seeking handing over of unencumbered

ROW/land and for undertaking validation of the ROW/Land, had

submitted a list of unchartered utilities, notified to the Respondent

98. Claimant sought extension due to the impact of this delay event

accrued up to 31 August 2016.

vi. _Delay caused to the work due to paucity of cash Flow

99. The execution of Works in the available fronts in MS-3 (and MS-1) was

price schedule, that too when completed work met the Engineer's
interpretation of payment procedure. The resultant effect of above
delay event was that substantial payment due for the work remained

unpaid in the relevant IPC.

In respect of the above, the Claimant had raised a dispute and filed its
claim in ICC Case No. 23923/HTG. An award was given in favor of
the Claimant on 15 November 2019. It was awarded that the
Respondent is liable to make Interim Payments for each Stage for
various items on a monthly basis on the basis of the actual progress of
work executed during the month, irrespective of whether the Stage has
been completed or not. The Respondent has not implemented the said

award.

Execution of work in the available fronts of MS-3 was adversely
affected due to the deficit in cash flow due to non-

payment/ withholding of Interim payments for the works undertaken.

The Engineer/Employer has admitted that the work in MS-3 was
delayed due to this event. However, the time impact of this delay event
accrued up to 31 August 2016 was not considered by the Engineer

while determining EOT.

Delay in completion of track work in MS-3 due to delay in formation
of MS-3 and delay to the track skeleton work of MS1 from that

planned in CCP:

CCP required that Civil and Track Skelton works of the section
Bhagega to Rewari shall be:;completed by 5 August 2015. Completion
of track skeleton for entire Package was to be done within 9 February

2017.

39


40

105. For laying track skeleton, mobilization of NTC at Bhagega was
planned. As per CCP, track Skelton from Bhagega to Iqbalgarh was to
progress after completing Bhagega to Rewari. Therefore, any delay to
the section Bhagega-Rewari will have a knock-on impact on

completion of MS-3.

106. Claimant was prevented from commencing track skeleton work from
Bhagega towards Rewari as planned in the CCP. To prevent the
resources for track skeleton being idle, the Claimant commenced track
Skelton from Bhagega towards Shrimadopur. Upon completion of
track skeleton from Bhagega - Shrimadopur, the Claimant commenced
track skeleton from Bhagega - Dabla, therefore, Claimant could not
commence the track skeleton from Shrimadopur to Iqbalgarh till 31
August 2016.

107. Sections in MS-3 also could not be developed in continuity due to
various Clause 8.4 Delay Events. This in turn delayed the track
skeleton of MS-3.

108. Pursuant to the aforesaid, revised date of completion of track Skelton

of MS-3 depended on following factors:

a) Time taken for completion of formation of various sections in

contiguity after concluding all delay events.

b) Date of recommencement of track Skelton of sections in MS-3 (in
sequence), after completing track Skelton of conjoint section.

c) Date of completion-of track skeleton of Bhagega to Rewari.

Even though the Claimant had mobilized resources as per the CCP,

because of the Delay Events the Claimant could not:
a) Finalise the design and commence RUBs;

b) | Commence Major Structures across numerous sections as there

was delay by IR in approval of the GAD;

c) Complete earthwork due to the Change in Law, NGT stay, non-
handing over of land, hindrances, non-completion of structures,
issues pertaining to RUBs and due to the modifications to the

Scope of Work;

d) Commence the track skeleton from Bhagega towards Rewari till
13 August 2016 due to unavailability of sections in continuity
which delayed commencement and completion of track skeleton

in other sections of MS-3.

Claimant had been notifying the Engineer /Respondent about various
Delay Events leading to delay in completion of the Work and its
entitlement to extension of time, cost and compensation due to such
Delay events. Copies of notices issued by the Claimant for each of the
Delay Events up to 31 August 2016 is filed at page 3569-5465 in Vol
CD-15 to Vol CD-18 and exhibited as Exhibit C-13 (Colly).

Owing to aforesaid Delay Events, only 34.48% of the works envisaged
in MS-3 could be completed by 9 February 2017. Claimant had to

EXTENSION OF TIME:

Claimant's Extension of Time Claim Submission

Various events resulting to delay in completion of MS-3 had a
continuing effect. Claimant, therefore quantified the impact of such
Delay Events to the Time for Completion at intervals and submitted its

claim for EOT of inter alia MS-3 to the Engineer for its Determination.

Vide letter dated 28 November 2016, Claimant submitted claim for
Extension of Time for completion of MS-3, MS-4 and MS-5 (excluding
sections under MS-1) considering impact of Delay Events accrued up
to 31 August 2016. In the said submission, the Claimant sought
extension up to 28 June 2019 for completion of MS-3. The delay of MS-
3 had a knock-on effect on MS-4 and MS-5. A copy of letter dated 28
November 2016 along with annexures thereto is filed with the SOC at
page 5466-8399 in Vol CD-19 to Vol CD-24 and exhibited as Exhibit C-
14.

Vide letter dated 2 March 2017, Claimant revised its claim of interim
EOT to include delay accrued up to 31 August 2016 under MS-1 as
well. A copy of letter dated 2 March 2017 along with annexures thereto
is filed with the SOC at Vol CD- 25 at page 8400-8566 and exhibited as
Exhibit C-15.

At the time of seeking EOT for completion of MS-3, MS-4 and MS-5,
Claimant notified its intention to and reserved its right to claim costs

ii. Engineer’s Determination of Claimant’s claims for Extension of
Time

116. Vide letter dated 24 August 2017, the Engineer after considering the

impact of Delay Events accrued up to 31 August 2016 determined the

revised date of completion of MS-3 till 11 October 2018. Comparative

Statement on Claimant's claim for interim EOT for completion of MS-

3 vis-a-vis the Engineer’s Determination thereto is set out below:

A copy of letter dated 24 August 2017 along with attachment is filed
with the SOC at Vol CD-35 at page 8567-9017 and exhibited as Exhibit
C-16.

117. The Engineer assessed the Time for completion of inter alia MS-3 be

extended by 608 days from 9 February 2017 till 11 October 2018

without imposition of Delay Damages and with adjustment for

Change in Cost.


iii. Methodology and assumptions formulated by the Engineer for
assessment of Delay Events:

a)

b)

118. The Engineer has carried out the analysis of Delay Events accrued up
to 31 August 2016 and its impact to the time for completion of MS-3,
MS-4 and MS-5 as per the methodology and assumptions set out in

brief below:

The Engineer has assessed EOT by critical path method analysis
considering the impact of dominant Delay Events to arrive at the

revised date of completion of MS-3.

No assessment of impact of other Delay events has been carried
out. One such instance is that, despite the contractual breach of
non-handing over of unencumbered ROW by the Respondent,
no EOT was assessed by the Engineer in respect thereof. The
Engineer has concluded that the delay due to encumbered
conditions should be absorbed by other concurrent (dominant)
delay during the extended period as a result of the Engineer's
analysis. It is obvious that Claimant's entitlement to EOT on
such counts was not rejected but, the Engineer has not
quantified the effect of the said delay event in the EOT
Determination, considering the same to be concurrent with the

impact of other delay events.

From the EOT assessment, it is evident that the track skeleton

was the critical activity and the same decided the Extension of

Time for completion of MS3 as on 31 August 2016.

d) The Engineer's EOT assessment was basis numerous
considerations which do not reflect the actual site conditions/as
constructed conditions or as per the Contract. One of the
example is the consideration made in respect of RUB with

associated further delays / Variation impact.

Consent by the Parties to the EOT Determination and Notice of
Agreement:

By letter dated 10 October 2017, the Claimant set out the factors not
considered in the Engineer’s assessment, and thus the Claimant
consented only to the number of days of extension namely 608 days
assessed by the Engineer in its assessment dated 24 August 2017 (as
interim EOT). A copy of letter dated 10 October 2017 along with
annexures thereto is filed with the SOC at Vol CD-25 at age 9018-9022
and exhibited as Exhibit C-17.

Vide letter dated 30 October 2017, the Engineer sought Respondent's

approval on “inter alia the following recommendations: -

EOT of MS-3, MS- 4 and MS- 5 by a period of 608 days (09
February 2017 to 11 October 2018), 589 days (1 June 2017 to 12

The Claimant is not liable to pay Delay Damages in respect of

inter alia extended date of MS-3 being 11 October 2018.

c) Claimant shall be entitled to Adjustment for Changes in Cost up
to the extended date as per the formula applicable for the

originally envisaged Contract period.

45


d) Claimant can be allowed to submit its claim for additional cost
due to EOT for completion of MS-3, MS-4 and MS-5 separately
as per Clause 20.1.

A copy of letter dated 30 October 2017 is filed with the SOC at Vol CD-

26 at page 9023-9135 and exhibited as Exhibit C-18.

121. Vide letter dated 10 August 2018, the Engineer issued a Notice of
Agreement in respect of EOT of inter alia MS-3 as per the Engineer's
determination dated 30 October 2017 duly certifying Respondent's
consent to the Engineer’s assessment of EOT recommended on 30
October 2017. In other words, Parties were in agreement with respect
to extension of 608 days for the completion of MS-3. A copy of letter
dated 10 August 2018 is filed at page 9136-9137 in Vol CD-26 and
exhibited as Exhibit C-19.

v. Claimant’s cost claims dated 30 October 2018 for additional
costs/payments incurred and compensation for losses suffered due
to execution of work of Milestone-3 from 10 February 2017 up to 30

June 2018
122. The Respondent had a duty to fulfil its contractual reciprocal
obligations, which it had to do as per the sequence and timelines in the
_ approved programme/CCP. The Respondent failed to fulfil its
BY l< obligations. The Respondent’s prior breaches had a cascading effect
Debajy, Bs and a direct bearing on the sequence and timing of activities leading
.No ye. _ to) the CCP being vitiated. In summary, the Claimant was prevented
; on lommencing and completing the works of MS-3 and hence, could

: ‘ 4 “not achieve MS-3 within the period envisaged in the CCP.

46


47

123. The execution of work for completion of MS-3 in the period beyond 9
February 2017 was not envisaged, and hence time related cost whereof

could not be catered for in the Contract Price.

124. Further, even in the extended period, planned execution of work was
affected due to the continuance of the delay events, occurrence of new
events and requirements inter alia Variations of the Contract, addition
of a number of structures and change in the order / sequence and
timing of construction etc. Therefore, the Claimant incurred cost in the
extended period which is neither catered for in the Contract Price nor

covered by the progress payments received.

125. Inthe instant case, the delays attributable to the Respondent prevented
the Claimant from not only utilising the resources deployed during the
scheduled Time for Completion of MS-3 i.e. up 9 February 2017 and
thus the Claimant was compelled to retain resources in the extended
period from 10 February 2017 up to 11 October 2018 for the completion
of MS-3 and on account of other facts set out in paragraphs

hereinbelow.

126. The costs incurred and losses sustained by the Claimant due to
execution of works in the extended period for completion of MS-3 is a
direct effect of the Delay Events under inter alia Clause 8.4 of GCC read
with PC, Respondent’s contractual breaches and additional

requirements set out in paragraphs below.

The EOT granted for MS-3 up to 11 October 2018 allowed the Claimant
to submit details of the additional cost separately after the revised date

of completion of MS-3, MS-4 and MS-5 was settled between the Parties.

On 30 October 2018, the Claimant submitted its Claim for additional
cost incurred and compensation for losses sustained totaling to INR
906,16,65,257 for undertaking works of MS-3 in the extended period
from 10 February 2017 to 30 June 2018, seeking the Engineer's
Determination. While the EOT granted extension of MS-3 up to 11
October 2018, the Claimant had collated the data of the cost incurred
up to 30 June 2018. Therefore, the Claimant submitted its cost claims
up to 30 June 2018 and reserved its rights to claim cost incurred in
further period. A copy of letter dated 30 October 2018 is filed with SOC

29299 and exhibited as Exhibit C- 22.

After hearing the Parties, the DAB gave its decision on 31 December
2019. The DAB held that Claimant is entitled to cost on account of
delays to the extent of 608 days minus concurrent delays, if any. The
DAB further recommended that the Engineer in consultation with the
Claimant to determine concurrent delays attributable to Claimant and
deduct the same from 608 days for assessing compensation. A copy of
DAB decision dated 31 December 2019 is filed with the SOC at Vol CD-

However, no such analysis was provided by the Engineer on or before
11 March 2020. On 16 March 2020, the Claimant reminded that the
Engineer's analysis was awaited. A copy of Claimant's letter dated 16

Vide letter dated 17 September 2021 i.e. after a gap of 17 months, the
Respondent asked the Claimant to submit further documents. A copy
of letter dated 17 September 2021 is filed with the SOC at Vol CD-59 at
page 29340 and exhibited as Exhibit C-28.

Engineer’s incorrect analysis of Claimant’s alleged concurrent
delays

As per the Engineer’s analysis of alleged concurrent delays, as
provided by the Respondent vide letter dated 5 May 2020, total
concurrent ee the Claimant was evaluated to be 911 days for MS-

3 wnat day : “7 up to 31 August 2016 was considered.


140. The Engineer's analysis of Claimant's alleged concurrent delays was
incorrect, inherently unreliable and is denied in toto on account of inter
alia the following:

a)  Itis acrude analysis relying on actual progress of work (already
impacted by the delay events), whereas the EOT determination
was based on Critical Path method of dominant Respondent

delays.

b) _ Delay to all activities (critical and non-critical) was assigned by
comparing the likely date of completion (based on actual
progress) with the revised dates allowed in the EOT (which was
interim and based on dominant delays). Such a comparison was

notwithstanding that, for some of the activities the Engineer has

i VA held that Claimant is entitled to EOT, but not assessed the
“revised time, as dominant delay method was used for

. jassessment of EOT. Therefore, the comparison was

= Crepproprate

c) The Respondent's attempt to compare the as-built status /
projected date of completion with the revised dates in the EOT,
arrived at by the Engineer on the above principle, is an

inappropriate comparison of unequal.

| d) The reliance on the Financial Progress (IPC) as proxy for the

actual progress of work. The Financial Progress does not depict
the Actual Progress. A graph depicting actual physical progress
of works (basis MPRs) made by the Claimant vis-a-vis the

financial progress from January 2015 to January 2017 has been

C- 127.

e) | EOT determined was based on the delay caused to track
skeleton being the critical activity for completion of MS-3, which
admittedly was delayed due to events attributable to the

Respondent.

The Claimant had also submitted the updated and_ revised

programmes to the Engineer to reflect the actual progress of work. The

Claimant had submitted the following:

(i) | Updated programme

(ii) | Look ahead programme

(iii) Revised programmes (but duly setting the conditions for
achievement)

(iv) MPR depicting the progress of the works and issues Claim for

interim extension of time for completion.

128 (Colly.). Copies of Revised Programmes submitted by Claimant to
Engineer have been filed at page 1563-2215 in Volume CD- 340 and
exhibited as Exhibit C-129 (Colly.). The Respondent was aware that
IPCs do not reflect the actual physical work undertaken; this is evident
from the letters dated 09 September 2015, 06 June 2017, 23 June 2017,

The Claimant asserts that there is no delay attributable to the Claimant
which led to delay in completion of the Milestones including MS-3. In
any event, the Respondent failed to raise the issue of purported
Claimant’s concurrent delays at the time of EOT assessment. The
Claimant has filed a table in response to the Engineer’s Flawed

Concurrency analysis at page 2277-2390 of Volume CD-341 and

exhibited as Exhibit C-131 (Colly.).

As the impact analysis prepared by the Engineer was fundamentally
flawed, on 06 November 2021, the Claimant replied to the letter dated
17 October 2021 duly (a) rejecting in entirety the Engineer's analysis
(b) stating the Engineer’s flawed analysis could not form the basis of
any bona fide attempt to amicably resolve the dispute between the
Parties (c) the documents sought from the Claimant were of no avail
in arriving at amicable settlement. The Claimant reiterated its intention
to commence Arbitration pursuant to Clause 20.6 of the GCC in respect
thereof. A copy of letter dated 06 November 2021 is filed with the SOC
at Vol CD-59 at page 29341-29342 and exhibited as Exhibit C-29.

Invocation of arbitration:

The Claimant vide letter dated 6 November 2021 rejected the Engineer's
assessment in entirety. The attempt for amicable settlement had failed

in resolving the dispute between the Parties. Accordingly, post

complying with all steps and pursuant to Clause 20.6 of the GCC, the
Claimant filed RFA on 24 January 2022.

RESPONDENT’S CONTINUING DELAY EVENTS/BREACHES
AND REQUIREMENTS IN THE EXTENDED PERIOD WHICH LED
TO RETENTION OF RESOURCES FOR COMPLETING MS-3
WORKS IN THE EXTENDED PERIOD

Consequent to the EOT granted, the Claimant stepped into the

extended period for completion of MS-3.

Even in the extended period, not only the Respondent has failed to
comply with its contractual obligations but also instructed the
Claimant to meet several requirements which were not in accordance

with the Contract. Some of such breaches / requirements are as under:

a) The Respondent requires Claimant to complete several RUBs in
parts as opposed to its 100% completion (as required under the
Contract/CCP) in one go, to facilitate laying track skeleton. This
requirement was pursuant to the Respondent inability to
handover land for approach road to RUBs as well as the IR’s
inability to construct conjoint RUBs on the IR tracks.

b) Non-handing over of ROW and obstructions/encumbrances

existing in handed over ROW.

c) Instructions for Variations ordered by the Engineer in the

extended period.

The Engineer unilaterally fixing the date for commissioning as
per the target given by the Respondent based on the requirement
set by the Ministry of Railways thereby, requiring the Claimant
to complete the works by such target dates. Such revised dates

were neither in accordance with the Contract nor as per the

54


148.

149.

sequence of construction envisaged in CCP. The Claimant was
instructed to complete works of certain sections ahead of Time
for Completion of Milestones as well as the whole Works by the
revised date despite the continuance of various delays
attributable to the Respondent. The Engineer’s instructions led to
changes in the planned requirements as well as planned

execution of works.
e) Continuation of delay events

The aforesaid events, instructions and requirements have been
collectively referred to as “Requirements and Breaches in the

Extended Period”

Execution of part RUBs (the portion remaining due to the
Requirements and Breaches in the Extended Period) in the period
beyond revised date of completion of RUBs as determined by the
Engineer.

Clause 7.1 (iv) of ER General provides the components of RUBs on the
DFCC track inter alia RUB boxes, retaining wall to retain the earth fill

of the main carriageway and approach road to the RUB etc.

To be able to execute the RUBs on the DFCC track, it was Respondent's
obligation to ensure completion by IR RUB on the IR track ahead or
simultaneously with RUBs on the DFCC track. This was not ensured
by the Respondent.As explained above, several RUBs on the DFCC
track could be constructed only after/along with the IR RUB.
Furthermore, embankments adjacent i RUBs could be undertaken

only after the RUB boxes on the IRs “anid DECC ‘tracks are placed and

gies
retaining walls are complete /. a |

55


149.

150.

Admittedly, even in 2015, the IR did not have funds to construct the
RUBs on IR tracks. The IR had not even floated tenders for construction
of RUBs on IR track in 2015. In fact, the IR had not even finalized the
location of RUBs. The span configuration of many RUBs on DFCC
track set out in the ER underwent changes as per the requirement of IR
and State authorities/National Highway Authorities of India
(“NHAI”). It was the Respondent who was coordinating with the IR
for obtaining approvals for RUBs. Letters exchanged between the IR
and Respondent evidencing immense delays by the Respondent in
obtaining IR’s approval of Integrated GADs as well as delay in
finalization and commencement of construction of RUBs on IR track is

filed at page 29343-29395 in Vol CD-60 and exhibited as Exhibit C-
30(Colly).

Meetings were held with the Respondent for finalization of plan for
commencement of construction of various RUBs, the completion
whereof was prevented due to various delay events attributable to the
Respondent such as (a) Respondent's failure to hand over ROW, (b)
non- construction of conjoint RUBs by IR, on IR tracks and (c) delays
in approval of IGAD, which was a pre-requisite to facilitate
uninterrupted track work. Copies of documents including minutes of

meetings and numerous correspondences evidencing delay by the

Respondent/ IR in finalisation of designs, Claimant's notice(s) to the
“} Engi r/ Respondent of the delays being caused due to approval of

“design documents, Respondent's failure to hand over ROW and non-

x construction of conjoint RUBs by IR on IR tracks have been filed at

page 29396-30368 in Vol CD-60-61 and exhibited as Exhibit C-
31(Colly).

152,

153.

In view of the Respondent's delays which it was unable to arrest, the
following decision (as recorded in Claimant's letter dated 07 January

2016) was taken in the meeting held on 26 December 2015:

i) In the case of RUB at LC locations, where the conjoint RUB is NOT
constructed by IR till date, the road traffic shall be continued through
existing LC itself. Therefore Contractor shall place the RUB boxes on
the DFCC track and the RUB boxes placed on the DECC track shall be
covered at the barrel ends.

ii) In the above cases temporary LC on DFC side shall be provided to
ensure safety and unhindered movement of the Road traffic.

The Claimant on 07 January 2016 notified its intention to claim

Variation in respect of the above decision. Copy of letter dated 07

January 2016 is filed at page 30369-30370 in Vol CD-62 and exhibited

as Exhibit C-32.

Since the Respondent was unable to arrest the aforesaid delays
attributable to it, on 17 March 2016, the Claimant was instructed that
in case of delay in joint construction of RUBs by IR, DFC RUB box should be
buried if possible, else the same shall be constructed later on. Copy of letter
dated 17 March 2016 by the Engineer to Claimant is at page 30371-
30376 in Vol CD-62 and exhibited as Exhibit C-33.

As per the CCP, construction of RUBs on the DFCC track including the
approach road and retaining wall had to be completed in one go. No

splitting of work was envisaged in the CCP/Contract. The

requirement of completion of RUBs in part was necessitated only due

to delay i dies to the Respondent (set out in paragraphs
hereinaboyéFeane the rages by the Engineer (in paragraphs

57


154.

155.

hereinabove) which led to 100% construction of RUBs as envisaged in

the CCP/ Contract being given a complete go by.

I state that while the Claimant was prevented from completing RUBs
as planned in the CCP, on the other hand, the Claimant was
constrained to complete RUBs in part to the extent available (box
completion/burial) etc. at the relevant time and to undertake the
remaining work (delayed due to Respondent/Employer delay events)
on a later date, when the same is available. Such unplanned execution
of RUBs had impact in terms of time and associated cost. Compilation
of letters 27 July 2016, 21 September 2016 and 21 September 2016 in
respect of part completion RUBs to the extent available (box
completion/burial) by the Claimant is filed with the SOC at Vol CD-
62 at page 30377-30386 and exhibited as Exhibit C-34 (Colly).

By way of illustration, I have hereinbelow set out details in respect of

issues pertaining to RUB at LC-83:

The IR RUB at LC 83 location was constructed prior to DECC
RUB. Retaining wall of IR RUB, however, infringed formation
and backfilling of RUB on DFCC side. The same is evident from
the Approved IGAD drawing at Page 23213 in Vol CD-378 of
Exhibit C-179.

By letter dated 30 March 2016 (Exhibit R-84 filed with SOD), the
Engineer has confirmed that the Existing IR retaining wall was
not dismantled till 03 December 2015 and movement of the
compactor to achieve required compaction in backfilling and

formation was improbable.

58


59

c) I state that backfilling for RUB and formation at this location
could be commenced only after the dismantling of IR retaining |
wall by IR. RUB at LC-83 was a covered RUB, with 1.95 M of fill
above the RUB box. Completion of formation at the above hold
up location was taking considerable time due to the fill height

and the requirement to undertake the work in layers.

d) I state that the track skeleton by NTC could not have progressed

forward until hold up at this location was removed and

formation was completed thereafter.

156. Notwithstanding that, execution of RUB in part was a Variation to ER,

the Engineer formulated the following considerations in EOT
Determination for assessing revised time due to the delay caused to

commencement and construction of the RUBs namely:

The delay in construction of IR RUBs by IR in locations where

either the center to center distance between IR and DFC RUBs is

less or level difference between IR & DFC track is more. In such

locations the construction of some of the DFC RUBs are required

to be undertaken simultaneously or after the construction of IR

RUBs. Such requirement delayed the construction of DFC

RUBs. The requirement has also been listed in the notes recorded

Stns, in the Integrated GADs approved by IR. In this context, one letter
| b en from the Employer (letter no. JP/EN/SLT/NWR/ Corres./12 dated

8 \“, 31-03-2016) is also relevant.

; JNe consideration of the above, there has been delays in
commencement of construction of some of the DFC RUBs

due to delay in taking up the construction of co-joint RUB

by IR, as the DFC RUB can be taken up either

simultaneously or after the construction of the co-joint RUB

by IR.


The delay in construction of DFCC RUB box (to the extent
required for laying of track skelton by NTC as the scope of
MS-3) at locations wherever it is necessary to construct the
same along with IR RUB/after IR RUB and IR RUB has not
been constructed has only been considered eligible for EOT

In all the other cases wherever either IR RUB is not
constructed or delay in completion of DFC RUB due to
requirement of additional _land_to construct the road
approaches_of RUB but DFCC RUB box has been
constructed/buried to the extent required for track skelton,
the same has not been considered eligible for EOT.

Accordingly, for the part completed RUBs where Track
Skelton has been laid i.e. NTC has passed or could be passed
through without the full completion of DFC RUB, no delay
has been considered eligible to achieve MS-3.

(Emphasis Supplied)

157. The Engineer confirmed that DFCC RUBs can be taken up either
simultaneously or after the construction of conjoint RUBs by IR. The
aforesaid consideration of the Engineer had the following impact:

a) In the case where IR RUB is not constructed, however,
placement of RUB boxes/ burial of RUB boxes can be done to

facilitate track skeleton work, MS-3 requirement will be fulfilled.

Even though CCP envisaged 100% completion of all RUBs in the
sections prior to commencement of the track skeleton of that
section, the Engineer did not consider time required for 100%

completion of the delayed RUBs.

In other words, the Engineer has not estimated time required for
100% completion all delayed RUBs (required as per the CCP) in
the EOT. The Claimant shall undertake works remaining in such

RUBs in the periods beyond the revised dates computed in the

60


158.

159.

160.

EOT for the completion of RUBs, that too after all such

hindrances are cleared.

The consequent requirements of part completion in paragraph above,
which is neither in accordance with the CCP/Contract, and considered
by the Engineer for assessing the EOT, has led to execution of majority
works for large number of RUBs in the period beyond the dates
approved in the EOT for the completion of RUBs. The Claimant
reiterates that Parties have agreed upon the number of days of
extension determined vide Engineer's EOT Determination for the
completion of MS-3. But the completion of remaining works of the
DFCC RUBs which was not considered in the EOT Determination had

cost impact due to its execution in the extended period.

Earthwork adjacent to RUBs is part of Formation can be completed
only after completion of each RUBs by way of (a) backfilling of the
completed RUB and (b) covering the completed RUB (in the case of
covered RUB). The completion of Earthwork for the formation
therefore required 100% completion of each RUBs including

completion of RUB boxes, retaining walls, approach road etc.

In this regard, it is pertinent to note the following:

a)  Ason31 August 2016 and even thereafter, there was no visibility
as to when the IR would construct 114 number of RUBs on IR
track and/or when land required for construction of approach

road would be provided by DFCCIL for 82 number of RUBs.

_

—— oe

ZAEaO PS

b) As is evident from the records, the actual construction of 35
number of conjoint RUBs by IR was inordinately delayed even

as on 30 June 2018.

c) The land required for construction of approach road of RUBs at
LC No. 138 and LC No. 121 in the section Swarupganj
Shriamirgarh was also provided by DFCCIL as late as on 27
October 2020 and 15 January 2021 respectively by way of
instruction for Field Change Notice for the construction of
approach road. Copies of approval of the Field Change Notices
are filed at page 30387-30398 in Vol CD-62 and exhibited as

Exhibit C-35(Colly).

d) Land required for construction of approach road for RUB at LC
No. 01 in the section Madar Saradhana was not handed over by
Respondent till July 2022. It was only on 18 July 2022 that
approach road for RUB at LC No. 01 was descoped. Copy of
letter dated 18 July 2022 is filed at page 30399 in Vol CD-62 and
exhibited as Exhibit C-36.

e) Location of RUB at LC No. 118 in the section Swarupganj-
Shriamirgarh was required to be revised by the Claimant as late

C* By as on 07 March 2020 due to revision in location of conjoint IR
RUB. The Claimant had to lay track skeleton at this location by

YE leepie filling earth (without placing any box) instead of
Y's: laying track over completed RUBs as required in the Contract.

CN * Aes) Copy of Field Change Notice issued by the Claimant dated 7
Nk Gy "March 2020 is filed at page 30400-30401 in Vol CD- 62 and
exhibited as Exhibit C-37.

161.

162.

f) Due to non-handing over of land as per the approved GAD and
agitation by locals, layout and orientation of RUB box and
approach road for RUB at LC No. 96 was to be revised on 23
February 2019 and 07 August 2019. Copies of Engineer's
approvals dated 23 February 2019 and 07 August 2019 of the
Field Change Notices are filed at page 30402-30410 in Vol CD-62

and exhibited as Exhibit C -38(Colly).

g) Time required for the completion of the portion of the RUBs
delayed due to events not attributable to Claimant was not
considered even in MS-4 or MS-5 by the Engineer in its EOT

Determination.

Tabular data regarding the status of RUBs, 100 % completion whereof
was prevented (prepared basis Claimant's EOT submission dated 28
November 2016) and the status as on 30 June 2018 prepared basis
correspondences in respect thereof is filed with SOC at Vol CD-62 at
page 30411 and exhibited as Exhibit C-39. The relevant
correspondences evidencing the status and continuation of the delay

events as on 30 June 2018 are filed at page 30412-30495 in Vol CD-62
and exhibited as Exhibit C-40 (Colly).

In summary, 100% completion of RUBs and associated earth work
were to be completed in MS-3 itself. The Claimant thus had no option
but to continue construction of RUBs in periods beyond the revised

dates for the completion of RUBs assessed in the EOT Determination

based on part completion of RUBs: NS

63


163.

164.

165.

ii.

166.

In this process, the Claimant had to retain the resources for the
Concrete production (like batching plant, Cranes, loaders), placement
of Concrete (such as Transit mixers, Concrete pump, Cranes etc.)
miscellaneous equipment (like Dumpers, crusher, rebar cutting
bending machine etc.) and earth moving equipment (like Excavators,
graders, compactors etc. for approach road etc.) to complete the
remaining part of the RUB (delayed due to Respondent delays) in the
allowable extended period of MS3. A list of broad categories of
equipment required for completion of RUBs is at page 30496 in Vol
CD-62 and is exhibited as Exhibit C-41.

As part of Engineer’s/Respondent’s attempt to narrow down the
impact of delay events which arose on account of Respondent's
aforesaid breaches and requirements, instructions for completion of

RUBs in part was issued from time to time.

I reiterate that the EOT Determination did not consider the time
required for execution of remaining works for part completed RUBs.
As such, the EOT Determination does not reflect resources which the
Claimant had to continue retaining for balance work beyond the

revised dates for completion of RUBs in the EOT Determination.

Execution of part of earthwork (portion delayed due to encumbrances
in the handed over section) in the period beyond the revised date for the
completion of earthwork as determined by the Engineer

Handing over of encumbrance free land is a fundamental contractual

obligation of the Respondent. Pursuant to express provisions of the

encumbrance free land in the manner and at the relevant time as

provided in the CCP.

A perusal of the CCP would reveal that unencumbered possession of
land for MS-3 section should have handed over from 27 September
2013 to 28 February 2014 to complete the Formation from Bhagega to

Iqbalgarh in continuity.

The key activity relevant to MS-3 is the track skeleton to be done with
NTC. Continuous developed Formation is a pre-requisite for track
laying. NTC cannot jump over discontinuity in the Formation,
therefore Track laying will have to stop wherever there is a gap in the
Formation. Laying of track skeleton required continuity of the

developed Formation to avoid delay to the work progress.

The Respondent had an express contractual obligation to hand over
unencumbered possession of ROW within such time stated in the
Contract. Claimant planned commencement and progressing of
Earthwork of various sections independently to complete the
Formation within such time stated in the CCP. The consideration was
that, the Formation of each section will be completed prior to
commencement of track laying in the relevant section. The activities
related to Earthwork (component of Formation) are developed in
layers and hence, the said activity has high time requirement for its

completion.

There was immense delay by the Respondent in handing over land.
Even the land handed: over was. not unencumbered. While non-
handing over of land led. to delay ih commencement of the work,

&

65


IZ 1,

2,

173.

handing over of unencumbered ROW led to holding up of the works

in part of the sections for substantial period.

Even as on 31 August 2016, 40.435 kms was not available. Out of the
said length, 36.035 kms (in 414 patches) was obstructed and 4.40 kms
was not handed over. This obstructed length does not include the
unavailable length/ gaps on account of the RUBs, the completion of
which was delayed due to various Delay Events. This can be seen from
the joint statement that as on 31 August 2016, unencumbered
possession of 40.4Km of land was unavailable. A table of obstructions
(section wise) existing as on 31 August 2016 is filed at page 30497 in
Vol CD-62 and exhibited as Exhibit C-42. A compilation of joint
statements from Rewari to Iqbalgarh evidencing the obstructed length
together with non-handed over ROW as on 31 August 2016 are filed
with the SOC at Vol CD-62 at page 30498-30607 and exhibited as

Exhibit C- 43 (Colly).

Further, as per joint statements prepared by the Parties, even as on 31
January 2017, cumulative obstructed length of 31.54 kms in 239 patches
continued to exist from Bhagega to Iqbalgarh. These obstructions,
within the formation, were not cleared even in the extended period. A
table of obstructions (section wise) existing as on 31 January 2017 is
filed at page 30608 in Vol CD-62 and exhibited as Exhibit C-44,
Compilation of joint statement from Bhagega to Iqbalgarh evidencing
the obstructed length as on 31 January 2017 is filed at page 30609-30728
in Vol CD-62 and exhibited as Exhibit C-45(Colly).

The Respondent failed to hand over the unencumbered possession of

land as per the schedule in the CCP. A table setting out details of the

WK

CCP handing over, the actual handing over of land by the Respondent
and the details of obstructions existing in the extended period and
beyond 30 June 2018 together with relevant documents are filed at
page 30729-31070 in Vol CD-62 and exhibited as Exhibit C- 46(Colly).

I reiterate that handing over of land free from all encumbrances is a
pre-requisite for timely completion of Earthwork. The Claimant could
develop sections up to Formation level only if full encumbrance free
lengths were made available. As per the CCP, the formation of a
section (including Earthwork) has to be completed up to the Formation

level prior to commencement of the track skeleton work of that section.

In the present case, the Claimant could carry out earthwork only in the
available unencumbered portions. No earthwork could be carried out
in the obstructed portions spread across numerous patches
intermittently across the length. The Claimant was thus prevented
from completing the Earthwork in MS-3 within the revised dates for

completion of earthwork while being constrained to retain resources.

Despite the above, the EOT Determination concludes inter alia that ...
as seen from the critical path analysis, the delay due to encumbered site
conditions (if any) should be absorbed by other concurrent (dominant) delay
during the extended period as the result of this analysis. As such, the
encumbrances at site were not considered for assessment of EOT,
hence, no quantification in respect thereof was made. The revised time
for completion of the Earthwork as assessed in the EOT does not assess

the impact of obstructions and hence completion efearthwork by such
tay aes Ns

time stated in the EOT was improbable“

178.

I state that it is evident from Exhibit C- 42 to C-46 that even as on 31

August 2016 and 31 January 2017, there were obstructions which
prevented the Claimant from completing the earthwork and
developing Formation within such time allowed in the EOT (impact
whereof was not considered). Therefore, earthwork in the obstructed
portion had to be completed in the periods beyond the extended

period allowed for the earthwork.

The unavailable and/or obstructed length required the Claimant to
continue retaining resources for the completion of Earthwork up to 30
June 2018 with resultant additional cost/ additional
payments/expenses and losses. The equipment required for the
completion of the earthwork upto 30 June 2018 inter alia include those
required for embankment, subgrade and blanket is detailed in Exhibit
C-47.

Claimant had been notifying the Engineer/ Respondent of the delay
being caused to the execution of the work due to the encumbrances in
the handed over sections. Claimant also notified the Engineer/
Respondent of its intention to claim Extension of time, cost and
compensation for the losses sustained due to this delay event. Copy of

some of the notices by the Claimant regarding delay being caused due

PS x \Neexecution of the work in the encumbered condition are filed at page
_— - 31072-31253 in Vol CD-63 and exhibited as Exhibit C-48(Colly).

Execution of Variation ordered in the extended period for which
separate time for completion is not agreed upon

The CCP does not factor in impact of Variations being a consequence

of instruction of the Engineer / Respondent. Variations, if occur /

68


180.

181.

182.

instructed, entitle the Claimant to time as well as cost. The cost under
Clause 13 of the Contract does not cover the time related cost due to

Variations.

In the present case, the Engineer directed numerous Variations (as
required by the Respondent) to the Claimant’s scope of Work. Such
Variations were ordered not only up to 31 August 2016 but also during
the extended period. A table containing major Variations ordered up
to31 August 2016, thereafter from 1 September 2016 to 9 February 2017
and 10 February 2017 to 30 June 2018 is filed at page 31254-31515,
31516-31527 and 31528-31586 in Vol CD-63 and exhibited as Exhibit C-
49, Exhibit C-50 and Exhibit C-51 respectively.

The Engineer assessed that Variations can be undertaken
simultaneously with other activities to complete the same within the
extended time for completion. The time impact of all Variations to the
RUB, RFO, ROB and other Major structures was not separately

considered in the Engineer’s assessment of EOT.

Few instances of the Variations for which assessment of time was not

done by the Engineer / the Respondent is as under:

a) | Some RUBs were deleted from the scope of work and some were
also added to it, up to as late as on 28 July 2016. However, the

Engineer considered that since there was no change in the total

number of RUBs, the addition of RUBs did not affect the time
for completion of MS-3. In this regard, the Table 11 of EOT
Determination (Exhibit C- 18) isrelevant.

b) __ In the case of Variations ordered from 10 February 2017 to 30
June 2018, no separate time for completion was agreed by the
Engineer/ Respondent prior to its commencement. Therefore,
these varied works were to be undertaken in the extended
period simultaneously with other activities which were delayed

due to various delay events attributable to Respondent.

c) The Engineer, in the EOT assessment, did not consider the
holding up of works on account of the Variations and its impact
to the time for completion. In summary, the Engineer required
Claimant to complete all ordered Variations in the allowed

extended period considering delay events as on 31 August 2016.

183. The Variations prevented the Claimant from executing the Formation
works and completing track skeleton work as per CCP and within the
extended period. As no separate time for Variations has been assessed
by the Engineer in the EOT Determination, the Claimant had to retain
resources intended for the completion of MS-3 by the scheduled date

“in the extended period for the completion of the varied works. The
€tiimant incurred time-related associated cost for such retention,
[fWhich is over and above those paid for under Clause 13.3 of the

Ag Gpnitvact.

iv. Instruction for Change in Sequence and Priority of Construction and
Completion, Fixing revised target dates for commissioning dates and
Pre-Fixing Dates Prior To EOT Completion Dates

184. In the meeting held on 8 February 2017 and pending determination of

EOT for completion of MS-3 as on 31 August 2016, the Claimant was

informed that Ministry of Railway (“MOR’) has fixed commissioning


targets for whole works as June 2018. Solely based on such revised
commissioning targets fixed by MOR, Respondent took a unilateral
decision and re-fixed the date for completion of Civil works for
Package A and B [CTP-1] and Package C and D [CTP-2] as January
2018 and March 2018 respectively. The Claimant was directed to
complete the Works by the said date. Copy of letter dated 16 February

2017 enclosing Minutes of Meeting held on 8 February 2017 is filed
with the SOC at Vol CD-63 at page 31587-31592 and exhibited as
Exhibit C-52.

185. Thereafter, on 11 August 2017, the Claimant was directed to plan its
activities in accordance with the revised commissioning dates of

numerous sections as follows:

188.

The Engineer had in the letter dated 11 August 2017 directed as
follows:

“... Stipulated time of completion of MS-1 to MS-5 has already been delayed
and Contractor's claim of EOT for MS-5 (Completion of all works and taking
over) is under review of the Engineer. Although the above dates are the target
for commissioning of WDFC Phase 1 section wise and do not link with any
dates of Milestones as per Contract Agreement and the Engineer's pending
determination for EOT of various milestones. It is advised to plan your work
activities in accordance with the above target date of commussioning and
organize your resources to achieve the project completion in line with the
requirements,

To comply with the directions of the Respondent, the Claimant had no
option but to retain its resources for prioritizing and completing Ateli
- Phulera section on March 2018 i.e., ahead of MS-1. The section of
Ateli-Phulera falls partly in MS-1 [From Ateli-Bhagega] and partly in

MS-3 [Bhagega-Phulera].

On 05 March 2018, the Claimant was again directed as follows:

a) The revised target date for commissioning of Madar - Marwar
section had been fixed as February 2019.

b) Ensure that all structures, stations and service buildings as well as
track skeleton were to be ready by November 2018 to enable the
STP-5 and EMP-4 contractor to conclude their activities by
February 2019.

c) To submit revised programme for completion of Madar-Marwar

section to meet the revised target date of November 2018 for

completion.

72


189.

190.

191.

d) To set out the additional resource (labour, equipment, material,
etc.) and/or the Revised Construction Method/Sequence to its

current works programme.

Copy of letter dated 5 March 2018 is filed with the SOC at Vol CD-63
at page 31595-31598 and exhibited as Exhibit C-54.

Further, vide letter dated 21 May 2018, the Engineer informed that the
Madar - Durai and Durai - Marwar section was planned to be
commissioned by November 2018 and March 2019 respectively. The
Claimant was directed to give major attention to the work left
incomplete in the entire section to complete the same within the
targeted period and formulate revised plan accordingly. Copy of letter
dated 21 May 2018 is filed with the SOC at Vol CD-63 at page 31599
and exhibited as Exhibit C-55.

Respondent's aforesaid suo moto decisions as to the change in priority
of completion of sections and target commissioning date was not in
accordance with either CCP or Milestones or the earlier EOT granted

to the Claimant.

The revised target date for commissioning of Madar - Marwar section,
though, had been unilaterally fixed as February 2019, the Respondent
handed over encumbrance free patch of 1.3 kms only on 2 February
2019 and Garhimaliyan cabin was handed over only on 8 October 2020

both in the Madar - Durai section.

From the facts stated above, it is. exident ‘that contrary to the sequence

of construction envisaged i in sd OCP, the Respondent was revising the

target dates and changing 3/ thes )
on

73


193.

194.

Respondent required Claimant to complete various sections as per the
priority being fixed by the Ministry of Railways/Respondent
unilaterally. Claimant was thus required to undertake the work as per
the requirement of the Respondent and was prevented from
undertaking and completing the work as per the planned / approved

sequence and timing in the CCP.

The Respondent was already in prior breach of its contractual
obligations. Instead of taking action to conclude delay events
attributable to it and allow extension of time for completion to enable
Claimant to complete the work within such times as per the planned
sequence and timing envisaged in the CCP, the Respondent
implemented the aforesaid decisions thereby, preventing the Claimant

from progressing work in a planned and orderly manner.

The resultant effect of the aforesaid is as under:
a) As the Claimant was instructed to work in accordance with the
revised target dates and on as is instructed basis, the

construction plan as per CCP was vitiated by the Respondent.

“~(b) The Claimant was required to retain all resources mobilized to

"Ss

“195,

complete MS-3 by 09 February 2017 and mobilize additional
resources in the extended period to complete the various

[asses whole work as per the revised dates prefixed by the
Respondent.

Since February 2017 the Respondent has interfered with Claimant's
planned sequence and timing of construction. Claimant was made to

undertake work remaining on February 2017 as per the Respondent's

74


196.

priority and requirement of completion, leaving the actual works
undertaken in variance with the Contract/ CCP. Thus, the works
undertaken in the extended period had additional cost impact. Having
rendered it impossible and impracticable for the Claimant to complete
the work as envisaged in the CCP, the Respondent is liable to
compensate the Claimant for all aforesaid delays and imposition of

unilateral decisions on the Claimant.

Claimant complied with these unilateral directions of the Respondent
and completed sections and the details of the same have been filed
with the SOC at Vol CD-64 at page 31600-31754 and exhibited as
Exhibit C-56. Following is the summary:

a) Trial run for track skeleton from Ateli to Phulera was conducted

on 27 March 2018

b) Track skeleton of the section Rewari Madar was completed on
15 December 2018 and trial run was conducted on 27 and 29
December 2018.

c) Track skeleton of the entire unobstructed sections from Madar
to Iqbalgargh (except for obstructed and non-handed over
section of Garhimalyan Cabin area and Keshavganj and Banas
private factory siding crossing) was completed on 23 February

2020.

197. The above are few instances/events which amounted to prevention
and required the Claimant to continue retaining resources in the
extended period for the completion of MS-3 reckoning the impact of

delay event as on 31 August 2016.

v. Continuing delay events

198. Claimant could not progress the work even in the extended period as
per the schedule envisaged in CCP due to continuance of the delay
events. The following are some of such events which were prevalent

in the periods beyond 31 August 2016 up to 30 June 2018:

a) Actual time expended by the Engineer for the review / consent/
NONO to Contractor’s design document exceeded the review

period stated in the Contract.

b) | Commencement of construction of Major structures (MJBs) was

delayed due to the delay in Engineer's consent/ NONO to GAD.

c) Delay caused to commencement and construction of RUBs due

to variations in the ER and reasons not attributable to Claimant.
d) — Non-handing over of unencumbered possession of land /ROW.

e). Suspension of part of the work since 30 November 2017

g) Variations to the Contract.

h) Delay to track skeleton of MS-1 and MS-3 due to delayed
completion of Formation pursuant to Clause 8.4 delay events

and MS-3 due to delayed completion of MS-1.

Further, the Contract stipulates consent by IR to GAD/span
arrangement of MJBs. Immense delay was caused by IR in review of
GADs of MJBs even after recommendation by the Engineer.
Construction of structures can commence post approval of GAD for
the structures. The EOT Determination has considered the revised date
of completion of structures prior to the approval date of GAD of the
structures. However, the Claimant had to continue retaining resources
for construction of MJBs, which could commence only post IR
approval of GADs. A table along with relevant correspondences
evidencing the delay by the Respondent/IR in approval of GAD of
MJBs has been filed with the SOC at Vol CD-64 at page 31755-31954

and exhibited as Exhibit-C-57 (Colly).

The hindrances due to the unchartered utilities continued as late as on
05 September 2020. Copy of Request for Inspection evidencing
obstruction of utility for 100 % completion of RUBs upto 05 September
2020 in section Madar - Saradhana is filed with the SOC at Vol CD-64
at page 31955 and exhibited as Exhibit-C-58.

and sequence in CCP. The resources mobilised for completion of MS-
3 (by 9 February 2017) had to be retained in the extended period for
executing not only MS-3 works but also to meet the additional
requirements of the Respondent as instructed by the Engineer from
time to time. The Requirements and Breaches in the Extended Period,

detailed above, had time and cost impact.

Vide letters Claimant notified the Engineer/Respondent of the above
delay events and Claimant's intention to claim extension of time, Cost,
payments and compensation due to such delay events. Copies of few
notices issued by the Claimant in respect of some of the above
continuing delay events in the period from 01 September 2016 to 30
June 2018 is filed with the SOC at Vol CD-64 at page 31956-31982 and

exhibited as Exhibit-C-59(Colly).

As is evident from Exhibit C-46(Colly) filed with the SOC, the last
section in MS-3 was handed over only on 22 February 2020 (with

encumbrances) and clearance of obstructions in MS-3 was done only

on 29 July 2021.

On 10 October 2018, Claimant sought further interim Extensions of
Time for Completion of MS-3 and other milestones considering delay
events as on 30 November 2017. On 12 September 2019, the Engineer
assessed impact of delay events continuing in the period beyond 31

August 2016 and recommended further interim EOT. The Respondent

has given its approval to the same. Copy of the Engineer’s assessment
of EOT dated 12 September-2019 is filed with the SOC at Vol CD-64 at
page 31983-32076-and exhibited as Exhibit-C-60.

In view of the continuing delay events, execution of works was
affected in the extended period. Claimant had to retain the resources
in the extended period up to 30 June 2018. Contractor incurred
additional cost/expenditure due to such prolonged retention of
resources. Claimant is entitled to all such additional cost/payments/
expenditure and compensation for the losses sustained due to the

retention of such resources in the extended period.

COST INCURRED BY THE CLAIMANT DUE TO THE
EXECUTION OF WORK IN THE EXTENDED PERIOD FOR THE
COMPLETION OF MS-3 WORKS FROM BHAGEGA TO
IQBALGARH

The cumulative effect of Respondent’s numerous breaches and delay

events had a drastic impact on time for completion of MS-3 as per the

original Milestone date.

The track skeleton and associated work from Bhagega to Iqbalgarh
contribute 39.44% of the Contract price of MS-3. Even as on 9 February
2017, the Claimant could complete only 5.56% of track skeleton from
Bhagega to Iqbalgarh of MS-3 due to discontinuity of the developed
sections. As on 09 February 2017, the Claimant could complete only

34.48% of total work required for achievement of MS-3.

Claimant was prevented from completing MS-3 by 9 February 2017.
Further, the Claimant was not allowed to work in the extended period
as per its planned sequence of construction.

completion of the activities like Earthwork, structures and track

whether impact of such delay events and/or breaches thereof was

accounted for or not in the EOT assessment.

211. Claimant had to retain resources (Plant and Equipment and Labour)

and On-site, Off-site Overhead in the extended period for:

The works which were outstanding as on 09 February 2017
(being delayed due to various Employer/ Respondent delays) as
stated in the Engineers assessment of EOT as on 31 August 2016.

To complete remaining part of RUB and the associated
earthwork in the extended period of MS3 as the time for
completion of same was not considered in MS-3 or MS-4 or MS-
5 in the Engineers assessment, notwithstanding that such works
are part of MS-3 and hence to be completed in MS-3. The
Claimant carried out placing of pre-cast of RUB boxes on DFC
track pending construction by IR RUB on IR track and conjoint
with DFCC RUB and approval of IGAD by IR.

Earth work/structures which were delayed due to
encumbrances in the handed over section, and clearance of

d) Completion of MS-3 works in various sections ahead of revised
dates as per EOT as the whole work was ordered to be
completed by February 2019 (commissioning) as per the target

date fixed by Respondent.

e) Variations ordered in the period from 09 February 2017 to 30
June 2018.

(a) Continuing delay events.

The Claimant was prevented from utilising the resources deployed in
the scheduled period and thus was compelled to retain such resources
for execution of MS-3 in the extended period. Claimant also had to
retain mobilised resources and mobilise additional resources in the
extended period to complete the Contract ahead of the revised dates

and due to various requirements added on and set out above.

The stepping into the extended period for completion of MS-3 i.e.
beyond 9 February 2017 is the resultant effect of the delay events (not
attributable to the Claimant) and on account of breaches/non-
compliances of various obligation by as well as additional

requirements of the Respondent.

The Claimant undertook numerous steps/measures to mitigate the
impact of delay including proceeding to work in the patches where
work fronts was being made available to it, undertook track laying as
and when substantial length of. ob agretian was developed, commenced
the track work from bragging opur instead of towards

215.

216.

217.

218.

Keeping in mind the numerous factors involved, the Claimant
formulated a clear plan for execution of the works which was accepted
as CCP. CCP bound the Parties contractually. Significantly, any
deviation from CCP not only causes delay to the execution of work but
also warrants addition of associated cost to accepted contract amount.
The CCP had to be followed by the Parties to ensure smooth

completion of works related to each of Milestones.

The Respondent failed to fulfil its obligations. The Respondent's prior
non-compliance had a domino effect and a direct bearing on the
sequence and timing of activities leading to the CCP being bypassed
and given a ‘go by’. In addition, thereto, the Respondent/ Engineer
directed numerous Variations/ requirements which prevented the

Claimant from executing work as per the approved programme.

The Claimant mobilized resources and was ready and willing to timely
execute the Works. The Claimant was, however, prevented from
commencing and completing the activities for MS-3 including
Formation/earthwork and consequently, the track laying, within the

period envisaged in the CCP.

Execution of work related to MS-3 in the extended period was not
within the contemplation of the Parties at the bid stage. The Contract
Price does not include cost due to extension of time for completion of

MS-3. The Contract price includes only the time related cost incurred

during the scheduled period of completion.

82


219.

220.

271.

222.

Up to 30 June 2018, Claimant could not complete MS-3. Activities
undertaken between 10 February 2017 and 30 June 2018 were in respect
of MS-3 and no activities for completion of MS-4 and MS-5 were
undertaken in the said period. Hence, no resources have been utilised
towards completion of MS-4 and MS-5 till 30 June 2018. The Claimant
has deducted the cost recovered from completion of track work in MS-

1 from 10 February 2017 to 30 June 2018.

Clause 13.8 of PC prescribes the formula based on which the amount
payable to the Claimant shall be adjusted for rise or fall in cost of
labour, goods and other inputs related to the works. The Contract Price
is formulated on the basis of cost of all inputs as on the base date. The
formula is representative of various components and does not
represent the actual changes in cost of such components and does not

cover the time related costs incurred by the Claimant.

Claimant accordingly incurred additional time related cost by
retaining resources in the extended period from 10 February 2017 to 30
June 2018 for execution of Relevant Works for Present Cost Claim
beyond the dates envisaged in CCP i.e. in the extended period.
Claimant also incurred additional cost/expenses by carrying out work

in the said extended period.

Considering the delays accrued up to 31 August 2016, the Claimant
has been granted EOT of 608 days from 9 February 2017 till 11 October

2018 for completion of MS-3 without imposition of Delay Damages

and "PEOER, Adjustment for changes in Cost. Further, the

resulted in all other Milestones including MS-5 getting further

extended.

The Claimant had, even at the time of making its EOT claim, reserved
its right to quantify the cost and compensation after settlement of inter
alia EOT for MS-3 between the Parties. The Engineer had, in its letter
dated 30 October 2017 assessed and recommended to the Respondent
that the details of the additional cost would be submitted after the
revised date for completion of inter alia MS-3 is settled between the
Parties. The proposal for submission of cost claim separately has been

duly accepted by both the Respondent and its Engineer.

Even though MS-3 has been extended till 11 October 2018, the
Claimant has submitted its claim for cost incurred and losses suffered
due to works for completion of MS-3 works from Bhagega to Iqbalgarh
in the extended period upto 30 June 2018 only. The Claimant reserves
its rights in respect of further costs and compensation for losses

sustained by it in the extended period beyond 30 June 2018.

NO DELAY BY THE CLAIMANT WHICH HAS LED TO DELAY IN
TRACK SKELETON WORKS OF MS-3

SLT was not in delay during the period where the events that resulted
in the 608-day EOT had effect. The assertions that SLT was
concurrently in delay with DFCCIL or that there were delays solely
attributable to SLT is incorrect.

Further, no isolated delay events , in any manner, prove that SLT was
in concurrent critical l delay with the delays to the agreed EOT of 608

unconditionally accepting the Engineer’s determination in respect of

SLT’s EOT claims.

Since the EOT has been granted due to delay events not attributable to
SLT but the Respondent, there was no levy of Delay Damages by the
Respondent.

I state that there is no delay by SLT on any of the counts - (a) Design
(b) execution of Earthwork (c) non-availability of resources / sub-
contractor at the Site. (d) delay in execution of Major Structures (e)
Delay in execution of Minor Structures (f) Delay in execution of Track

work- which has led to delay in track skeleton works of MS-3.

CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF DELAY EVENTS ON THE TRACK
SKELETON WORKS:

(a) Bhagega - Dabla Section:

As per CCP the work of Formation of the section Bhagega - Dabla
comprising 34.5 Km of Earth work, 17 number of RUB (as per Contract)
and 4 Major structures shall commence on 23.12.2013 to complete the
same by 29.11.2014. CCP mandated that the Track skeleton will
commence post completion of the Formation of the section Bhagega -
Dabla. With the completion of Formation on 29.11.2014, it was planned
that Claimant can commence the Track skeleton on 02.01.2015 to
complete the same by 27.03.2015. Completion of Track Skeleton as

above was inevitable to achieve MS1 and MS3 on the Scheduled date

Execution of the work inthe section Bhagega - Dabla as per CCP was

vitiated by various delay events with a result that Claimant could not

85


complete the Formation as planned and commence the Track skeleton

from Bhagega - Dabla as per CCP. Following are the particulars:

a)

b)

The Engineer as per Contract was not appointed on the
commencement date and the Engineer designate / Employer
was not having the required resources for the time bound
review of Contractor’s design documents. It was only after
series of piecemeal review by the Employer NONOC to the
Plan and profile of this section was issued on 29.01.2014. Copy
of the Letter dated 29 January 2014 is annexed herewith as
Exhibit CW -1/5.

Claimant was not allowed to commence the work as per the
Plan and Profile for which NONOC was issued on 29.01.2014
citing the requirement of approved GFC drawings to
commence Earthwork. It was only on 03.02.2014 the land for
this section was handed over with encumbrances. The
Employer also required that the ‘alignment verification
report’ should be prepared jointly with the Engineer. Upon
compilation of field data as above Contractor submitted GFC
drawings on 27.03.2014. However approval of the GFC was
delayed up to 04 July 2014 after the Engineer is appointed and
its independent review / assessment on piecemeal basis.
Copy of letter dated 27 March 2014 and 04 July 2014 are
annexed herewith and marked Exhibit CW-1/6 (colly).

CCP envisages that Contractor will submit the design

documents for. the Minor bridges / RUB in this section from

86


87

29.11.2013 to 09.01.2014 for the Engineer’s consent/ NONO
from 10.01.2014 to 30.01.2014. Contractor submitted the
design documents seeking consent to the span configuration
of the RUB since 17.12.2013, however, approval of the span

configuration was delayed due to:

i. Delay in appointment of the Engineer and the Engineer
designate not having the required resources for time
bound review of design documents.

ii. | Requirement of the Employer that NONO P&P shall be
issued by the Engineer prior to review of the span
configuration.

iiii Delay by the Employer / various authorities in

approving the span configuration.

d) Pending approval of Span configuration 2 out of 18 RUBs by
the Engineer/ Employer, on 05.11.2014, the Employer decided
in consultation with IR that the GAD of the RUBs shall be
approved by the IR prior to commencement of its
construction. Claimant was directed to submit GAD showing
the integrated arrangements of RUB on the IR and DFCC track
seeking approval of IR for this purpose. This required GAD of
IR RUB to be arranged by the Employer for preparation of
IGAD. All design documents submitted by Claimant up to |

Nov-2014 became redundant due to the above additional

IR has taken substantial time for the approval of IGAD and
accordingly commencement of all RUBs in the section

Bhagega to Dabla was delayed.

It is planned in the CCP that Claimant shall commence
construction of RUB in this section on 24.02.2014 to complete
the same by 11.11.2014 so that completion of the formation by
29.11.2014 is ensured. However, approval of IGAD of the
RUBs were delayed up to October 2015 thereby, delaying

completion of every single one of the RUB substantially.

The Engineers consent/ NONO to the design of MJB was also

delayed for no fault of Claimant. Following are the facts.

i. As per Contract the span arrangement of MJB shall be
approved by the Employer IR prior to the Engineer
notifying the Claimant with the Engineers consent/
NONO. Claimant can commence the TD only after the
Engineer communicating NONO to Span configuration
. Pursuant to above requirement of Contract, on
08.11.2013 Contractor submitted the Span configuration
of all four major bridges seeking approval of IR.
Employer however required Contractor to develop the
request for span arrangement in to a detailed GAD
including technical design components before seeking
approval of the Engineer. This was not part of the
Contract.

iv.

Employer further required that the Engineer’s review of
GAD for all RUBs and MJBs etc. shall be done post
approval of the P&P, which is a new requirement

imposed.

Further to above delay, the Engineer’s review of the
Claimant’s GAD was done piecemeal, and Claimant was
made to comply many of the Technical Design
requirement (like Engineers consent / NONO to GIR and
Hyrdology) made prior to seeking approval of the Span
arrangement, when the Contract specifies that technical
design requirement shall follow approval to span
arrangement. Accordingly, NONO to the GAD was
delayed. These GADs for which NONO was issued by
the Engineer had to undergo review by the Employer /
IR for the mandatory approval reckoned in the Contract
before commencement of Technical Design

/ construction.

Some of the GAD for which NONO issued by the
Engineer and recommended to the Employer / IR was
returned by IR seeking correction/ revision in the
requirement and Claimant had to spend additional time
for revising all such GADs for which consent was
already issued by Engineer. Examples of such
revisions in Bhagega to Dabla include MJB 26 and
Bhagega to NR include MJB 19

v.  IR’s approval to the GAD was thus delayed for no fault

of the Claimant.

vi. Contractor could complete the TD of these MJBs only
after GAD is approved by IR. Commencement of the MJB

was accordingly delayed.

section.

i) Span configuration of Br. 26 was modified following the IR’s

review and revised GAD was approved only on 01.05.15.

On 09.09.2013 the state of Rajasthan amended the mines and minor
mineral rules as per which claimant was required to obtain EC for
mining of minor minerals from the mines having an area less that 5 Ha.
It became a requirement to obtain EC for mining of Earth and Stone.
Commencement of the earth work and structures were delayed due to

the above change in law.

When the process for EC as per the change in Law was in progress, the
NGT stayed the process of EC in the state, and which was vacated only

on 13.01.2015. Claimant however could commence the earth work in

filling from borrow pit since Dec 2014 as per the revised statute dated

26.11.2014.

Total quantity of cutting in the Contract was only 15.45% of the total
quantity of embankment and subgrade. Cutting was spread across the
Contract and hence to be used in embankment at economical lead. . In
the case of Bhagega - Dabla section, the total quantity of filling
(Embankment and Subgrade) is 18,81,600 cum whereas the quantity of
cutting is 5,08,800 cum in 39 strips. Even if it is reckoned that 100 % of
cut fill in this section can be used for Embankment, the objective of
completing the Formation in continuity, a requisite for track linking
could not have been achieved. To the extent possible Claimant carried
out Earthwork in cutting and used the cut spoil in embankment up to
Dec-2014. In summary spoil evolved from cutting could not mitigate
the delay caused due to Change in Law and NGT stay even partly as
the earthwork in filling could have been met only from earth obtained

from borrow pit due to its massive requirement.

Commencement of earthwork in filling from Bhagega - Dabla was
thus delayed from 23.12.2013 to 11.12.2014 (delay by over 104%) due

to the above delay event not attributable to Claimant.

Execution of earth work was also hindered by the encumbrances in the
handed over section. As on 31.01.2015 6.38 Km of the section was
unavailable for construction. Even as on 31.08.2016, 0.48 Km was
unavailable. Besides the above there were number of gaps in the
formation due to non-construction- of RUB delayed due to the

requirement of IGAD and its delayed approval by IR. In summary
7

91

236.

237.

Claimant could not complete Earth work even up to 31.08.2016 due to

reasons not attributable to it.

The additional requirement of IRs approval to IGAD and delay by IR
is approving the IGAD delayed commencement of construction all 17

RUBs in Bhagega - Dabla.

Contract requires the RUB on the DFCC track to be constructed
conjoint with an RUB on the IR side to be constructed by IR. It was also
a construction requirement that RUB on IR track be constructed ahead
or simultaneously with DFCC RUB. Construction of RUB on the IR
track was delayed by IR, with a result that Contractor could not
commence construction of RUB on DFCC track for substantial period.
Hold up of works of RUB due to non-construction of conjoint RUB by

IR is submitted as under:

Since the Respondent was unable to arrest the aforesaid delays
attributable to it, on 17 March 2016, the Claimant was instructed that
in case of delay in joint construction of RUBs by IR, DFC RUB box
should be buried if possible, else the same shall be constructed later
on. Copy of letter dated 17 March 2016 by the Engineer to Claimant is
filed herewith as Exhibit C-33.

Besides the above in the month of Sept 2015, the Engineer issued
instruction to undertake and construct an additional RUB LC 72 on the
DFCC track and LC 70 on the IR track. The IGAD of RUB 70 was
approved on 18.09. ane. and GAD of RUB 72 was approved on

10.02.2016 for the cofmmnencement of construction. Additional time

for the back filling to ensure that formation of the section Bhagega -
Dabla is fully developed to receive NTC for laying track skeleton as
reckoned in the CCP.

Pursuant to above causes of delay Claimant could not complete the
formation as per CCP up to 29.11.2014. Contractor however
progressed the work on as is available basis with a result sections
developed in discontinuity and the developed section was not

conducive to progress the track skeleton with NTC as planned.

In January 2015 [Vol. CD-183/Exhibit C-96/Page-95092] and upto

September 2015, even the earth works up to formation level within
Bhagega- Dabla section could not be completed [Vol. CD-184/Exhibit
C-96/Page -96045] due to the 14 obstructions set out hereinbelow,

which delays were not attributable to the Claimant.

Besides the above, as on 02 January 2015, the Claimant could not
commence 17 RUB and complete 4 MJBs in Bhagega Dabla section due
to the Respondent delays. Thus, completion of formation from
Bhagega - Dabla (Earthwork and Structures) by 02 January 2015 was

impossible.

Due to discontinuity of completed formation, track skeleton work with
NTC and associated resources could not be commenced in Bhagega-

Rewari prior to 02 January 2015.

As is evident from MPR of September 2015 [Vol. CD-184/Exhibit C-
96/Page -96045], the Claimant could only complete continuous
developed formation in work segment 27-28 i.e., in Bhagega -

Srimadhopur stretch, so that SOURIS of NTC became possible

since then in the said stretch. % « BR R e %

cut to fill and 12.12.2014 due to NGT) Claimant could commence
the earth work at this location.

Unhindered execution of the earth work was affected by
hindrances in the handed over section totalling to 1.43 KM as on
31.01.2015 and 0.49KM as on 31.08.2015.

Bhagega - Shrimadopur comprises construction 18 RUBs
including 1 additional RUB added on _ 07.09.2015.
Commencement of RUB in this section was delayed due to the
requirement of IGAD and delay by IR is approving the IGAD.
Commencement of the RUBs were delayed up to 16.05.2016 due
to this cause.

2 number of MJBs (17 and 19) in this section were delayed since
the Engineer’s consent / NONO to MJBs were delayed up to
01.05.2015 due to the delay by IR in approving the GAD already
recommended by the Engineer after a series of piecemeal
review. Despite that the Claimant commenced preliminary

works for MJB-17 of on 17.11.2014 and for MJB-19 02.02.15.

Details of delay in commencement of the components of

As on September 2015, Claimant could not develop the complete
formation (comprising Earthwork, Major and Minor structures) from
Bhagega - Dabla or Bhagega -Shrimadopur to commence the track

work as required in the CCP.

Even though NTC was mobilied at Bhagega to commence track laying
from Bhagega towards Dabla, since developed formation was not
available due inter alia hinderances and obstructions, the Claimant
could not undertake track works from Bhagega towards Dabla. Based
on the status set out in the table above and to avoid idling/under-
utilisation of track resources, the Claimant commenced Track Skeleton

work from Bhagega towards Shriimadhopur in September 2015.


252. Even in September 2015, section Bhagega - Shrimadopur was not free
of hindrances and hence Claimant had to progress the Track Skeleton
under hindered conditions. Therefore, Claimant could not optimise
the productivity of the NTC up to the actual date of completion of the
track skeleton at this location in July 2016 as the progress of work basis
the available work front. The hindrances to which the works were
subject to in the period Sep-2015 to July 2016 is as under:

253. By July 2016 Claimant completed the Track Skeleton of the section
Bhagega - Shrimadopur. Formation from Bhagega towards Dabla
could not be completed fully even at that time due to the ongoing
Respondent delays and additions. Even by 27th July 2016, Claimant
could not develop any sections beyond Shrimadopur towards

Iqgbalgarh in continuity due to the ongoing hindrances like IR running

line, RPF Barack etc. at Reengus (Refer Para 156 of Claimant's

Rejoinder). “RY

Pursuant to above, post completion of track skeleton of Bhagega -
Shrimadopur, vide letter SLT/6551 dated 27 July.2016, Claimant
sought Engineer’s instruction on sequence of construction to be
followed i.e., go forward with the track skeleton towards Iqbalgarh or
to commence track skeleton of Bhagega - Rewari section to complete
MS1. Copy of the Letter dated 27 July 2016 is annexed herewith as
Exhibit CW- 1/8.

The Engineer vide letter dated 13.08.2016, instructed to Claimant to
achieve MS1 as per Contract Agreement. Copy of the Letter dated 13
August 2016 is annexed herewith as Exhibit CW-1/ 9.

Temporary Y Connection

NTC cannot lay track in reverse direction. Therefore, at Shrimadopur
Claimant constructed temporary Y Connection, to turn the NTC and
to lay track skeleton towards MS1 i.e., Bhagega - Rewari section. An
illustrative drawing of Y Connection along with photographs have

been annexed herewith and marked as Exhibit CW-1/10 (Colly).

CCP was formulated reckoning that the track skeleton can progress in
an orderly and sequential manner and that the project will not be
subject to any delay / variations. Therefore, requirement of Y

connection could not be envisaged in program.

Construction of Y connection was reckoned to be a temporary work in
the Scope of Claimant and hence was not separately recorded in the
progress reporting to the Engineer/-Respondent. However, the work

from Bhagega towards Dabla’commenced only on 13 August 2016 i.e.,

16 days after completion of the track skeleton of Bhagega -
Shrimadopur. This time was consumed for Y connection and moving

the NTC back to Bhagega from Shrimadopur on the laid track.

259. Shifting of NTC envisaged in the CCP was for the track Skeleton from

Marwar to Madar which was planned over IR track and to this effect

Para 2.5 and 5.1 of EOT Determination is relevant.

260. Formation of the section Bhagega - Dabla could not be completed even
on 27 July 2016 due to the ongoing hindrances and obstructions. The

following are the particulars.

a) 0.48 Km of the section was unavailable due to hindrances.

b) 0.18 Km of the section was unavailable due to non-completion
of RUBs due to various Employer delays.

Cc) 04 Number of RUBs (RUB 77, 75, 60 and 57) could not be
completed due to non-construction of IR RUB.

d) 01 RUB (RUB 72) under DFCC track added to the scope of
Contract on 30.09.2015 and 01 RUB (RUB 70) under live IR on
07.09.2015, due to the time required for its completion.

261. Notwithstanding that formation of the section Bhagega - Dabla section
could not be completed by August 2016 due to the continuing delay
event, as Claimant developed a continuous section of 3.54Km of

Formation from Bhagega towards Dabla track skeleton of this section

was commenced since Aug 2016 on as is available basis )


Moving the machine across up / downlines was a time-consuming
process which slowed down the track laying. Specific clarification
in this regard is as under:

262. It is evident from the extract below that the Claimant had planned to
complete Down line and Up line one after another. i.e., to complete
either down or up main line of a section first in one go and thereafter
to complete the other line. In short, the Claimant had planned to move
the NTC machine between up and down lines only once for each

subsection.

*A Snap shot from CCP in Exhibit C-6 is extracted above.

263. It was also planned that Claimant will commence the track skeleton
only after the formation of the section is completed so that the above

plan is fulfilled.

264. The number of forward and backward movements of NTC considered
in the CCP was only once in each subsection so that optimum

utilization of NTC is ensured.

265. However pursuant to delay events, Contractor could not follow the

plan and sequence as.per gE. For the actual execution,

106


107

commencement of the track skeleton was NOT done after formation of
a section was developed or else track skeleton was done with
hindrances and hence progress as per CCP could not be ensured.
However, this could not take place and the Claimant had to move the
NTC machine between up and down line many times because there
was no available work front for NTC to progress the track works.
Contractor had to ensure forward and back ward movement of the
NTC frequently and/ or lay track skeleton the up or down line to the
extent available to engage the NTC and/ or to reduce idling of NTC.
This has increased the cycle time for the completion of track skeleton
due to number of backward movements of NTC- and frequent
stoppages. A table in respect of number of backward movements of
NTC for Bhagega - Shrimadopur is annexed herewith as Exhibit CW-
1/11.

266. In this regard, Engineer’s letter NKC/1606-70 dated 27 June 2016,
[page 8393 to 8395 in Volume CD 24 Exhibit C-14] states as below:

“On an average DFCC crossing station are situated at 35 to 40 km
distance whereas average length of Work Segment is 3 to 3.5 km.
NTC works in linear way and to lay both the track parallel
Work Segment wise involves shifting of NTC every alternate
day. Taking back NTC to Crossing station to change the line
will lose one working day on every shift that will impact the

project progress

The above situation is not good for the project progress and
work will get delayed. So, ideal way to execute the track work
is first to lay one line (up line or down line) from one station
to next station than second line, the same sequence has also
been defined In CCP.

Considering both line. to complete “n particular work segment will

~~ virtually lead to a situation: Fea appraxcimatel y 9 to 10 Work Segment

268.

matures at a time for payment, This situation is defeating the basic
purpose of dividing total length in Work Segments, which was done
to ensure requisite cash flow at proper interval. As per contract the
payment has to be made on completion of particular work segment for
main line, As both the line i.e UP & Down are the separate main line,
Therefore Item of Work No. 3.0 & 3.1 will be claimed on completion
of individual main line (Up or down) in a Work Segment after due
deductions as mentioned in further deliberations”.

FURTHER INTERIM EXTENSIONS GRANTED CONSIDERING
THE IMPACT OF DELAY EVENTS ACCRUED UP TO 30
NOVEMBER 2017

The delay events considered by the Engineer while granting EOT did
not conclude even as on October 2018. There were further Extension of
Time upto 07 August 2021 considering delay events beyond 31 August
2016. Since Delay Events were continuing, SLT reserved its rights for
further EOT on the said count. SLT has sought for further EOTs and
the Engineer has recommended the same. As on date, EOT of MS-3
considering delay events up to 31 January 2021 is under determination

of the Engineer.

To date, the Engineer has, from time to time, assessed SLT’s

entitlements to Extension of Time as follow:

COST CLAIMS

The present claims pertain to additional cost incurred/ payments due
and compensation for losses suffered for completion of MS-3 works of
the stretch Bhagega to Iqbalgargh (less Technical Design) from 10
February 2017 to 30 June 2018 [Relevant Works for Present Cost
Claim]

Therefore, in order to compute the present cost claims, the Claimant
has computed the value of Relevant Works for Present Cost Claim as

follows:

a) From the component of the Contract Price, the Claimant has
derived the value of works of MS-3 for the stretch from Bhagega
to Iqbalgargh.

b) As the Claimant has notified a separate claim for Technical
Design (“TD”), the Claimant has excluded TD for the portion of
Bhagega to Iqbalgargh from the above value of works.

Fd

109


271.

272.

273.

274.

The aforesaid methodology is detailed below.

Value of MS-3 works of the stretch Bhagega to Iqbalgargh [less TD]

MS-3 is completion of track skeleton for entire Package i.e., from
Rewari to Iqbalgargh to be completed within 09February 2017. MS-1 is
completion of Civil and track skeleton from Bhagega to Rewari to be

completed by 5 August 2015.

Based on Schedule 3, Schedule 4.1 and Cost Centres contained in the
Contract, I have computed the valuation using the data set out in IPC
- 21. The gross value of work from Bhagega to Iqbalgargh includes
value of work relevant to MS-4 and MS-5. Therefore, from the gross
value of work from Bhagega to Iqbalgargh, I have deducted contract
value of MS-4 and MS-5 relevant to section Bhagega to Iqbalgargh to
arrive at the contract value of MS-3 for the section Bhagega to

is additional. These Costs are a direct consequence of Extension of
Time as well as Respondent’s Requirements and Breaches in the
Extended Period coupled along with numerous Respondent's
breaches which prevented the Claimant from completing MS-3 by 09
February 2017.

The Onsite Overhead are as per the actual cost incurred by the

Offsite Overhead cost is time related. The Offsite Overhead catered for
MS-3 in the Contract Price has been incurred by the Claimant on 9
February 2017 (date of completion of MS-3).

However, owing to various Delay Events and all other factors
attributable to the Respondent which prevented the Claimant from
completing Relevant Works for Present Cost Claims by 09 February
2017, the works had to be carried out in the extended period.

Claimant had to continue maintaining the Offsite overheads relevant

2018. is INR 5,88,91,532

Accordingly, the total Offsite Overhead of both partners of Claimant
Consortium for carrying out the Relevant Works for Present Cost

Claim in the extended period is an amount of INR 78,70,42,922/-

Cost incurred due to retention of Plant_and Equipment in the
extended period:

At the time of submission of bid, the Claimant had envisaged that it
would be able to complete all the work of MS-3 by 9 February 2017.
The Claimant accordingly computed the requirement of Plant and
Equipment to be deployed at site. Further, it was understood by the
parties that upon completion of various activities by the dates
envisaged in the CCP, Plant and Equipment deployed for such
activities can be demobilized to other project sites for utilization

therein.

Due to the occurrence and continuance of various Delay Events, Plant
and Equipment deployed for the work remained idle/underutilised
during the original period of completion of MS-3. To complete MS-3,
Claimant was constrained to retain Plant and Equipment beyond the

dates set out in the CCP.

The Plant and Equipment retained in the extended period were also
governed by the requirements of the Engineer/ Employer as set out in

paragraph hereinbefore.

Such prolonged retention of Plant and Equipment is not catered for in
the Contract Price. Due to prolonged retention of Plant and
Equipment, Claimant incurred time related cost on Plant and
Equipment which is over and above the cost that was included in the

Contract price.

Plant and Equipment deployed by the Claimant fall under following 3
categories:

a) Own Plant and Equipment

b) Hired Equipment

c) Equipment deployed by Piece Rate Workers (“PRW”)

(a) Cost incurred on Claimant's own plant and equipment:

The cost of Claimant's own Plant and Equipment comprises
Ownership/ Owning cost (time related cost) and the operating cost
(production-based cost). The time related owning cost includes

depreciation, interest on capital investment and insurance.

The owning cost is time related and hence is affected by the works

being carried out in the extended period.

The Claimant has calculated time related owning cost of equipment as

per the principles and methodology set out in IS 11590 : 1995

standard widely accepted in construction industry (in India).

As per Para 2.2 of IS 11590 the Ownership / Owning Cost of the
Equipment comprises

(i) Interest on Capital investment

(ii) Insurance cost

(iii) Depreciation

The methodology to be followed for the computation of the Owning
Cost is provided in Para 2.2.1 to 2.2.3 of IS 11590. The Life and Repair
provisions of various equipment is provided in Annexure A of the IS
11590. Claimant has computed the Unit Ownership Cost of various
equipment owned and deployed by it in the extended period to
complete the Relevant works for Present Cost Claim, as per the

contemplations of IS 11590.

Claimant has hereinbelow carried out a sample calculation of owning
cost of “Excavator 2.85 cum” Make- L&T Komatsu PC -450 (Asset
1370090) [SI. No. 2 in Exhibit C- 92] as per IS 11590 which is one of the

period up to 30 June 2018 was INR 20,99,500/-.

308. Similarly, Claimant has computed additional Cost of INR
61,45,26,661/- incurred by it due to retention of 318 Own Plant and
Equipment beyond dates in the CCP and up to 30 June 2018. A
tabulated chart of Unit cost of 318 number of Own Equipment
deployed beyond the planned date of completion as per CCP up to 30
June 2018 is filed with the SOC at Vol CD-177 at page 91634-91643 and
exhibited as Exhibit C- 92. The computation of additional Cost
incurred by the Claimant due to the retention of the Own Equipment
in the extended period up to 30 June 2018 is filed and filed with the
SOC at Vol CD-177 at page 91644-91653 and exhibited as Exhibit C- 93

309. In support of its claim for Cost incurred in respect of Own Plant and
Equipment, the Claimant has filed herewith copy of IS 11590 -
“Guidelines for working out unit rate cost of the construction
equipment used for River Valley Projects” is at page 91654-91662 in
Vol CD-177 and exhibited as Exhibit C-94.

perusal of the said table would reveal that the unit cost considered for
the claim for own plant additional cost is minimum as per the industry

norms.

(b) Cost incurred by the Claimant on Hired Equipment:

311. The Claimant entered into agreements with numerous agencies for
providing Plant and Equipment on “hire charge basis”. Irrespective of
whether the hired equipment(s) are used or not, the Claimant is

required to make payment to the equipment suppliers.

312. The hired plant and equipment were also required in the extended
period to complete MS-3. The Claimant had to incur cost on hired
equipment in the extended period on account of its continued
deployment which is a direct cost to the Claimant. The Claimant has

claimed the actual cost incurred by it towards the hire charges for plant

and equipment beyond the period envisaged in the CCP for

completion of Relevant Works for Present Cost Claim.

313. By way of illustration, I have hereinbelow set out the sample

computation for Cost incurred in respect of “Excavator Komatsu L&T,
PC200” hired through the vendor “Ajab Singh Construction” for
| Earthwork. As per the approved programme, Earthwork of MS-3
should have been completed in the period 23 Dec 2013 to 24 November
| 2016, which could not be ensured due to various Clause 8.4 Delay

Events. The Claimant has incurred INR 41,10,313/- towards hire

charges of the said excavator beyond the dates set out in the CCP and

Claimant has been granted Extension of Time.

In order to complete Relevant Works for Present Cost Claim, Claimant
had to retain the PRW’s equipment in the period beyond the
completion dates set out in the CCP. The Claimant had to retain
resources of the PRW in the extended periods up to 30 June 2018, also
due to reasons stated hereinbefore which are not attributable to

The Cost incurred on PRW Equipment has been computed basis the
principles and methodology set out in IS 11590. Sample calculation of
the Excavator PC -450 (Asset 1370090) set out in preceding paragraphs
is also relevant for PRW Equipment. Details of the unit owning cost
per hour of the Equipment deployed by the PRW up to 30 June 2018
for undertaking various activities beyond the date of completion
reckoned in the CCP is filed with the SOC at Vol CD-280 at page 152010
and exhibited as Exhibit C- 100.

From the period of Retention of Equipment in years, number of
Equipment and Minimum hours (3000 hrs/ Annum) to which these
equipment were to be used in the Relevant Works for Present Cost

Claim, the Claimant arrived at the Extended Stay hrs of the equipment

as - Period of Retention X Number of Equipment X 3000 Hrs/ annum.

Based on the extended stay hours of the PRW Equipment as above and

unit owing cost of Equipment per hour as computed in Exhibit C - 100

Cost incurred by the Claimant on the PRW equipment in the extended
period for the Relevant Works for Present Cost Claim has been

computed as - Extended stay Hours of the PRW equipment x Unit

owning cost per hour.

Following the aforesaid methodology, the Claimant has computed the
total Cost of INR 41,39,02,516/- incurred by it for the completion of
Relevant Works for Present Cost Claim in respect of all PRW’s plant
and equipment. Computation of cost incurred by the Claimant on
PRW’s plant and equipment is filed with the SOC at page 152011 in

Cost incurred on Labour

Claimant reckoned that various activities contemplated in MS-3 could
be progressed as per approved time programme, so that MS-3 is
completed by 09 February 2017. Claimant required different category
of labour namely highly skilled ("HSK"), skilled (“SK”), semi-skilled
(“SSK”) and unskilled (“USK”) to undertake and complete numerous
activities such as Embankment, Subgrade, Blanketing and Concrete
comprising concrete placement, Reinforcement, Formwork, handling

of materials etc.

Based on the quantum of work, time available for construction, labour
turnout etc., the requirement of labour to undertake and complete
activities in MS-3, as aforesaid was arrived at and provided at site. It
was envisaged that upon completion of the relevant activity, the
labour engaged for the work could be demobilised in phases by such
time as per the approved programme. The time programme submitted
by the Claimant was based on the Engineer/ Respondent fulfilling all
their reciprocal obligations in the manner and within the contractual

timeframe. The time programme was accepted as CCP.

Claimant could not fully utilise the labour employed for MS-3 as per
its original schedule/plan due to Delay Events as set out hereinbefore.
Consequently, Claimant could not complete MS-3 as per the approved
time programme. The Claimant was constrained to retain labour as in
the extended period to ensure completion of Relevant Works for

Present Cost Claim. Besides the above, the Claimant was constrained

to retain Labour in the extended period eee tane 2018 due to

of labour was not catered for in the Contract Price and has caused

Claimant to incur Cost on labour, over and above that included in the

Contract Price which is a direct cost to the Claimant. Claimant is

entitled to all such unforeseen cost.

Claimant has computed cost incurred by it on account of retention of

all categories of labour for ensuring completion of Relevant Works for

Present Cost Claim beyond 09 February 2017 as per the statutory

provisions.

For various categories of Labour, cost of labour per day comprises of

the following components:

a)

b)

Minimum Wages which are paid in accordance with the
notifications issued by the Government of India from time to
time setting out basic wages and dearness allowance in respect

of different categories of labour.

Statutory benefits - such as (1) Bonus under the Payment of
Bonus Act, 1965 and (2) Provident Fund under the Employees'

Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952.

Other Benefits - As per Clause 6.1 of GCC read with Clause 11
of Appendix 15 of the Employer's Requirement, the Claimant
is required to provide the labour employed certain other
benefits inter alia Accommodation, Water and Electricity,

Transportation etc.

exhibited as Exhibit C-106 (Colly).

334. The cost incurred on Labour is time related. The Cost of Labour catered
for in the Contract for completion of MS-3 till 9 February 2017 has
already been incurred by the Claimant. For the period of 10 February
2017 to 30 June 2018, the Claimant has incurred INR 63,52,85,786/-
towards retention of labour for the completion of Relevant Works for

Present Cost Claim in the extended period up to 30 June 2018.

vi. Additional Cost incurred by the Claimant on Fuel for the works done
in extended period from 10 February 2017 to 30 June 2018 which is
uncompensated by adjustment formulae under Clause 13.8 of GCC
read with PC

335. The time for completion of MS-3 was extended up to 11 October 2018,
duly considering impact of Delay Events accrued up to 31 August
2016. Claimant had to carry out works in the extended period
incurring Cost and losses for completing Relevant Works for Present

Cost Claim.

Contract payments i.e., cost of fuel and power catered for in the

Contract and adjusted as per Clause 13.8 of GCC read with PC.

337. Clause 13.8 of GCC read with PC allows Adjustment for Changes in
Cost of various inputs. The weightings representing the estimated
proportion of cost element for Fuel and Power related to execution of

works in Clause 13.8 of GCC read with PC are provided in the table

338. In the instant case, the time for completion of MS-3 has been extended
on account of Delay Events and Respondent's Requirements and
Breaches in the Extended Periodwhich are not attributable to the

Claimant.

339. Cost incurred on Fuel and Power in the extended period was not

recompensed by Adjustment for Changes in Cost even when diesel

was considered as the representative cost of component Group “Fuel

and Power”. Claimant, therefore, incurred additional cost on diesel by

341,

undertaking the Relevant Works for Present Cost Claim in the

extended period.

In respect of the Relevant Works for Present Cost Claim undertaken in
the extended period, the Claimant has claimed compensated as per the
actual cost incurred on Material, Fuel and Consumables and not be
limited to the base cost, plus Adjustment for Changes in Cost as per
formulae envisaged in Clause 13.8 of GCC/PC. The Claimant is
seeking the actual additional cost not covered by the formula for the
Adjustment for Changes in Cost contained in Clause 13.8 of GCC read
with PC.

The methodology followed by the Claimant for the computation of

additional Cost incurred on Fuel for July 2017 has been set out

133

hereinbelow.

342. As is evident from the above, against INR 8,58,76,075/- expended in
July 2017 for diesel, the Claimant could recover only INR 7,46,03,110/-
. Therefore, an additional amount of INR 1,12,72,965/- lakhs was

343,

incurred by Claimant in the said month.

For the sample calculation for July 2017, the Claimant has relied upon

the following documents:

a) Material Receipt Notes for July 2017 in respect of the unit rate of

Diesel.

b) Wholesale Price Index of March 2017 and June 2017 which has

been considered for the computation of Adjustment for Changes

in Cost for July 2017.

Tabular Chart of additional cost incurred by Claimant on Diesel in the
extended period for completion of Relevant Works for Present Cost
Claim upto 30 June 2018 is filed with the SOC at Vol CD-158162 and
exhibited as Exhibit C-107. It is evident from the said chart that against
INR 184,33,17,225/- expended from 10 February 2017 to 30 June 2018
for diesel, the Claimant could recover only INR 155,03,52,487/- i.e. an
additional amount of INR 29,29,64,737/- was incurred by Claimant.

In support of the calculation of additional cost incurred between 10
February 2017 to 30 June 2018, the Claimant has filed the following

documents:

a) Tabular Chart of month wise value of work completed by the
Claimant between February 2017 to June 2018 as per certified

Table A of Schedule 1 Clause 13.8 of the GCC read with PC
pursuant to changes in WPI indices is filed with the SOC at Vol
CD-333 at page 178323-178350 and exhibited as Exhibit C-114.

From 10 February 2017 to 30 June 2018, the Claimant has incurred INR
29,29,64,737/- on diesel for the completion of Relevant Works for
Present Cost Claim which is not recompensed by the formula for the
Adjustment for Changes in Cost contained in Clause 13.8 of GCC read
with PC.

Interest on additional funds arranged by the Claimant to meet the
Overhead Cost in the extended period.

At the time of submission.of bid, the Claimant envisaged that it could

commence and progress the work in the planned and sequential

136


348.

349.

350.

manner to complete MS-3 on the Scheduled date of 09 February 2017.
It was perceived that the Claimant could work within the parameters
of the quoted price and recover the time related Onsite and Offsite
overheads incurred by it as provided in the Contract by completing

the works within the Contract period.

Due to various Delay events attributable to the Respondent, Claimant
could not commence and progress the work as per the CCP. The time
for completion of MS-3 was extended due to such delay events,
requiring the Claimant to continue with the execution of work in the

extended period to complete MS-3.

By virtue of execution of work in the extended periods, Claimant could
not recover the Onsite and Offsite overhead cost incurred up to the
Scheduled date of completion at the relevant time. On the other hand,
the Claimant continued to incur additional Onsite and Offsite
overheads to complete the works in the extended period. Overhead
cost expended in the extended period could not be recovered from the
Interim payments linked to the progress due to the delays to the

execution of the work.

In order to meet all additional and unforeseen cost on Claimant's
Overheads for the completion of Relevant Works for Present Cost
Claim in the extended period from 10 February 2017 to 30 June 2018,
Claimant had to arrange funds from its own source. The funding to
meet the Overhead Costs in the extended periods were on account of

delays not attributable to the Claimant.

137


138

351. I have calculated the interest on the funds arranged to meet the
additional Onsite and Offsite overheads incurred in the extended
period from 10 February 2017 to 30 June 2018 for the Relevant Works

| for the Present Claim which is filed with the SOC at page 178351-

178491 in Vol CD-333 and exhibited as Exhibit C-115.

352. Claimant planned to complete work worth INR 5731,04,21,420/- up to
31 January 2017. Claimant incurred Onsite overhead of INR
429,78,27,102/- up to 31 January 2017. This account for 7.5% of the
value of work planned. The contribution of HO/ RO expenses of the
Claimant up to 31 January 2017 was 3.83% with respect to the planned
value of work. Thus, up to 31 January 2017 the Claimant has incurred
Onsite and Offsite Overhead at the rate of 11.33% of Contract Value.
The same is tabulated in Exhibit C-115.

353. Claimant had to continue maintain the same level of Onsite and Offsite
Overheads costs in the extended periods for completion of MS-3 works
from Bhagega to Iqbalgarh. These Overheads are met from own
sources or capital borrowing as these Overheads were additional and

beyond that catered for in the Contract.

354. By way of illustration, I have hereinbelow computed interest on

unrecovered overheads of SLT for the month of March 2017:

Calculation of interest on the funds arranged to meet the Overhead in
the extended period from 10 February 2017 to 30 June 2018 is filed with
the SOC and exhibited as Exhibit C-115. Total interest incurred by
Claimant on overheads incurred in the extended period from 10

February 2017 to 30 June 2018 is INR 32,69,14,710/-.

In support of the claim for interest on the additional funds arranged

by it, the Claimant has filed documents at page 178492-178501 in Vol
CD- 333 as Exhibit C-116 (Colly).

Loss of opportunity and profit

As per CCP, the Claimant had envisaged completion of MS-3 by 09
February 2017, deploying inter alia Plant, Equipment, Labour and
Overheads as. Upon completion of MS-3 by 9 February 2017, the
Claimant could demobilise these resources to some other projects for

re-deployment and commercial gain.

However, on account of delay events, breach and requirements of the
Respondent, Relevant Works for Present Cost Claim had to be carried
out in the extended period beyond 09 February 2017. SLT has been
granted Extension of Time without imposition of Delay Damages. SLT
had no option other than to stay in the extended period beyond 09
February 2017 up to 30 June 2018 with inter alia all its Plant, Equipment,
Labour and Overheads to complete MS-3.

If DFCCIL had fulfilled its contractual obligations in timely manner,
there would not have k e REG any delay in completion of the works for
MS-3. Consequently, “the Piaimant would not have been required to

and Overheads and could have utilized these resources in some other
project of similar nature and type for earning revenue from other
projects on hand. SLT had to continue using the resources without any
corresponding increase in monetary benefit and without being free to
move elsewhere to earn the profit which otherwise it might have
earned. SLT has been deprived of the opportunity to redeploy these

resources to some other project for commercial gain and earn profits.

Pertinently, SLT was awarded the works of similar type and nature by
the Respondent in the extended period such as CTP14 (awarded on 09
January 2017) and CP 303 (awarded on 15 March 2018).

List of some of major projects for which an agreement is entered into
by the Claimant during the extended period of MS-3 along with
supporting documents have been filed with the SOC at 178502-178526
in Vol CD-333 and exhibited as Exhibit C-117 (Colly). A List of Projects
not secured by the Claimant in the period from February 2017 to
October 2018 along with letter dated 08 May 2017 of Claimant to CPM,
Rail Vikas Nigam Limited requesting for return of Bank Guarantee is

filed at page 74548-74559 in Vol CD-478 and exhibited as Exhibit C-

For calculation the Loss of Opportunity and Profits detailed in the table

that payments due from Respondent to the Claimant shall be made
within the period set forth in Clause 14.7 of GCC read with PC. In the
event of delay beyond such period, the Parties had agreed as contained
in Clause 14.8 of GCC read with PC and ATB that the Respondent shall
pay interest for the period of delay calculated at a rate equal to 8% per
annum compounded monthly on the amount unpaid during the
period of delay, and recovery thereof shall be without any formal
notice or certification or without prejudice to any other right of the

Parties.

c.
In accordance with the instruction of the Engineer/ Employer dated 16.12.2013, we

Further as directed by the Engineer/ Employer on 24.12.2013, the drawings were again

Length of vertical curve at chainages 66956, 78077, 79099, 79806, 81383

The length of the vertical curves at chainages 79099, 79806, 81383, 
90317 are rounded off the 25m, where as the length of vertical curves at 
chainages 66956 and 78077 if kept 25 the radius reduces below 4000m 
which voilates the employers requirement and hence the length of the 
curve at these two locations is kept as 35 i.e. multiple of 5 as per the 
discussion in DFCC HQ.
3
List of horizontal curves & alignment not provided for Up & Dn lines 
separately.
We had already incorporated the details of the curve for UP & Down main 
track of alignment plan and profile drawings in the said submission as per

this ROW start Km is between 73/100 to 73/200.

As directed ROW shown but distance from centre line of IR not marked. 
ROW should be given in the plan.
We have already submitted 'Alignment Verification Report' vide letter

affect the plan and profile drawing. 
7
Vide letter ref.(3) alignment verification report Bhagega - Dabla section in 
which offsets of ROW given in coordinates but no distance given due to 
which ROW can not be verified.
