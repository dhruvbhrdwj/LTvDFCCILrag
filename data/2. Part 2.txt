EMPLOYER'S REQUIREMENTS
GENERAL
1 Introduction
1.1 The 1° phase of the Western Dedicated Freight Corridor consists of 922km of double line

electrified track with 2x25 kV AC, 50 Hz. Overhead catenary system from Vadodara to
Rewari running along the existing Indian Railway Tracks.

Construction of the 1° phase of the Western Dedicated Freight Corridor has been planned
through eight (8) Contract Packages encompassing the following contract scopes:

CT P-1 Civil/Building/Track Works Rewari — Ajmer Section; .
Combined Package
CT P-2 Civil/Building/Track Works Ajmer —Ikbalgarh Section;
CT P-3 Civil/Building/Track Works Ikbalgarh — Vadodara Section (excluding bridges
across river Mahi and Sabarmati);
CT P-3A Special Steel Bridges across river Mahi and Sabarmati;
EM P-4 Electrical & Mechanical, Rewari — Vadodara Section ;
ST P-5 Signal & Telecommunication, Rewari ~ Vadodara Section;
PE P-6 Plant and Equipment for Operation and Maintenance; and
RS P-7 Rolling Stock Cum Maintenance And Depot Works.

1.2 Out of the total length of 922km, it is intended to first carryout the work between Ikbalgarh
and Rewari in a length of 625 km and is to be constructed as double line electrified track
with 2 x 25 kV AC, 50 Hz, overhead catenary system, capable of operating at a maximum
train speed of 100km/h with an initial axle load of 25.0 tonnes. Formation and bridge
structure are to be provided for 32.5 tonnes axle load and track structure for 25 tonnes axle
load.

Ikbalgarh — Rewari stretch is located along Palanpur — Phulera and Phulera — Rewari lines
of North Western Railway. Detour is planned at Phulera city for around 7 km length. The
proposed alignment between Ikbalgarh - Rewari is located on east side of existing IR. The
proposed alignment of DFC is passing generally parallel to the existing IR network between

(2) For reverse curves, it is preferable to maintain a radius of 875 m or greater to enable
application of long welded rails.

(3) The actual radius of both the tracks shall remain same. This will be achieved by shifting the
centre of the curve suitably.

(4) Minimum length of straight length between adjacent curves:

(a) Desirable: 50m. In cases, where there is space constraint, both transitions can meet
each other by suitable extending the lengths ensuring that rate of change of cant and
versine along the two transitions so extended is kept the same.

Cant and Speed
The curve speed and cant relationship shall be based on the following equations:
Actual Cant Ca =GV/127R

Where Ca: Actual cant [mm]
G: Dynamic Gauge in mm i.e. 1750 [mm]
V: Equilibrium Speed in km/hr i.e. 85 [km/hr]
R: Radius of the curve [m]

The standard speed for actual cant shail be defined by considering the maximum permissible
speed (100 km /hr.), speed restriction, gradient and train operation plan. The equilibrium speed
of actual cant setting for general section shall be 85 km/hr. The cant computed shall be rounded
off nearest 5mm. The allowable applied cant shall not be over 140 millimeters and the cant
deficiency shall be limited to 75 millimeters.

Cant transition shall be straight ramp. Cant excess shall be limited to 75mm.
Transition Curves

(1) In general transition curves shall be provided between a circular curve and adjoining
straight, and wherever possible between the different radius of a compound curve and at
the adjoining ends of circular curves forming reverse Curves.

(2) Transition curves shall be in the form of a cubic parabola curve in the Contract. A transition
curve length shall be defined by the maximum of the following three values:

Standard Transition Curve Length (La, Lp and L.):
(a) L,=0.008Ca X Vm

(s)) Lp = 0.008 Cd x Vm

(c) L, = 0.72 Ca

Where L: Transition curve length [m]
vm: Maximum permissible speed [km/hr] (= 100 km/hr)
Ca: Actual cant [mm]
Cd: Cant deficiency for Vm [mm]

Chainage of the IPs and transition curves in the Alignment Drawings are referential. The
chainage on the plan and profile is for reference only.

Among the values La, L, and L,, the greatest value is provided as the Standard Transition
Curve Length..

However in exceptional cases where adequate room is not available for providing
sufficiently long transitions in accordance with the above, the length may be reduced to a
minimum of 2/3 of the desirable length as worked out on the basis of formula (a ) and (b)

(3) Vertical curves shall not coincide with horizontal transition curves but could be coincide
with circular curves.

(4) Vertical curves shall not coincide with point and crossing work.

Gradients

The Ruling Gradient on the project is 1 in 200 i.e. 0.5% (Compensated).

The limits for Ruling Gradient shall be as follows:

(i)
(ii)

(iii)
(iv)

(v)

Maximum gradient for the Main Line : 1/200 i.e. 0.5% (Compensated)

In Rewari — Ajmer Section (Package CT P-1), due to construction of Road Over Bridge
(ROB) at Level Crossing No. 28 in Kishangarh, the requirement of gradient of 1/200 is
relaxed to 1/180 over a stretch of 1280m length between the chainage 82100 — 83380
(Section 12); retaining a ruling gradient of 1/200 (compensated) from chainage 83380 to
83860 along with the corresponding dispensation in the vertical clearance for OHE by
0.30m at both these locations.

The maximum gradient shall be reduced by considering the curve compensation. The
curve compensation shall be defined as follows:

Curve Copmensation = 70/R [%]
Where R : Horizontal curve radius [m]
No change of Gradient in transition curve and within 30m of any points and crossings

The approaches of all “Important Bridges” shall preferably be level for 100m from the
abutments. If for any constraint of unavailability of adequate space, the same can be
reduced up to 50m with the consent of the Engineer.

In case of other “Major bridges” there shall not be any change of gradient within 40m from
either of the abutments. Only in very exceptional cases, like in flyovers, change of gradient
on the bridge can be permitted by the Engineer with the approval of the Employer.

staggered 750m long loops at Crossing Stations except at Banas, Keshavganj, Saradhna and
Bangurgram Stations where 2 x 750 long loops are to be provided. The CSR for the purposes of
design shall be defined as the distance from fouling mark on one side to the fouling mark on the
other side of the yard line.

Station Yards are defined by the layouts within the advance starter of UP track and advance
starter of DN track.

The Contractor shall prepare and submit monthly, a Physical Progress Report based
on eamed value techniques. The contractors proposal for ‘the Physical Progress
Report and basis for measuring progress shall be prepared in accordance with the
requirements listed below and shall be submitted to the Engineer within 42 days after
the Commencement Date.

Selection of work activities

(a) Eamed value progress reporting requires that the Contractor's work activities
be broken down into discrete measurable-units that are time phased (0% to
100% complete) in accordance with the Contractors programme and
maximum limit. These discrete measurable units shall be based on the
physical deliverables and the prorata value of the items / milestones in order
to summarize the activities into a planned percent complete curve. The format
for presenting the earned value progress measurement information in a
Physical Progress Report is to be considered by the Engineer.

(b) Coordination work activities with Other Contractors and other relevant entities
for reporting progress shall be prepared by the Contractor and submitted to
the Engineer for review / consent.

(c) To the maximum extent possible, activities shall be chosen which can be
measured quantitatively rather than subjectively as the work progresses. In
the event it is necessary to use activities that can only be measured
subjectively, intermediate activities or milestones shall be identified on the
programme in which the Contractor shall establish a predetermined
intermediate percent complete for the activity at attainment of each
intermediate milestone. Such milestones shall be no more than one month
apart.

Activity weighting

In order to summarise the key individual activities into an overall planned or actual
percent complete, activities shall be weighted. Various methods for determining the
appropriate weighting can be used. The Contractor may propose an existing
methodology comparable to the intent of the earned value concept. The Engineer
shall assess and, if appropriate, consider the method proposed by the Contractor.
The sum of the weighting for ail activities shall equal one hundred percent (100%).

Revisions to Physical Progress Report

Once the weightings have been established, the planned progress curve shall be
calculated and forms the basis of monitoring the progress of the Work. It shall not be
changed unless there is a variation that significantly impacts on the programme. If,
after consideration, it is decided by the Engineer to incorporate a major variation, the
planned and physical progress curves shall be revised incorporating the impact of
approved variation The curves shall be recalculated and shall be submitted to the
Engineer for consideration prior to its use in the Monthly Progress Reports. Another
time-phased planned activities shall remain unchanged during this process in order
to maintain the integrity of the precedent programmes and most of all Contractual
Construction Programme in any event.

The drawings produced by the Contractor for submission to the Engineer / Employer shall
generally be to ISO A1 size unless otherwise instructed by the Engineer. They shall
display the title block containing the information / details as specified here in and shall be
got consented frorn the Engineer in advance

CAD Standards
Introduction
The main objectives of the CAD standards are as follows:

(1) To ensure that the CAD data files produced for project are coordinated and
referenced in a consistent manner.

(2) To provide the information and procedures necessary for a CAD user from one
discipline or external organization to access (and use as background reference),
information from a CAD data file prepared by another discipline or external
organization.

(3) To standardize the information contained within CAD data files which may be
common to more than one discipline such as drawing borders, title boxes, grid lines
etc.

(4) To establish procedures necessary for the management of CAD data files.

(5) To ensure all the contractors use ‘Model Space’ and ‘Paper Space’ in the production
of their CAD files’.

CAD Data Creation, Content & Presentation

A consistent method of CAD data creation, together with content and presentation is
essential. The method of CAD “Model Space” and “Paper Space” creation shall be as
follows:

(1) Model Space Files

(a) Typically CAD “Model Space’ files shall be required for general arrangement
and location plans and shall consist of a series of other “Model Space”
referenced CAD files covering the total design extents at a defined building
level (the number of referenced files shall be kept to an absolute minimum).
Data contained within a CAD “Model Space” files shall be drawn at full size
(1:1) and tocated at the correct global position and orientation on the Project
Grid / or defined reference points.

(b) Each CAD “Model Space” file shall relate to an individual discipline. Drawing
border / text, match / section lines or detailed notation shall NOT be included
within a CAD “Model Space’ file. Dimensions shall be included within a CAD
“Model Space” but located on a dedicated layer. Elevations, Long Sections and
Cross Sections shall also be presented in CAD “Model Space” as defined
above, but do not need to be positioned and orientated on the Project Grid.

(2) Paper Space CAD Files
(a) “Paper Space” CAD files shail be utilised to aid the process of plotting “Paper”

drawings and shall be primarily a window of the CAD “Model Space” file. A “
Paper Space” CAD file shall typically contain drawing borders, text, match or
section lines & detailed notation. Once these files are initially set up and
positioned the majority of “Paper Drawing” plots at various scales as consented

by the Engineer shall be efficiently and consistently generated by displaying
different combinations of element layers and symbology contained within the
“Paper Space’ file and the referenced “Model Space’ files.

APPENDIX 11

RELIABILITY, AVAILABILITY AND MAINTAINABILITY (RAM)

General

The project is to be designed with a high degree of reliability and availability, in order to
provide a dependable service thereby increasing patronage and revenues from the system.
The optimisation of the system with respect to reliability, availability and maintainability shall
be planned and shall form an integral part of the project from its inception through to its
operational life as the ‘life cycle cost’ of a major system is an aspect which in the long term
can affect the financial viability of the project.

The Contractor shall demonstrate that the issues of RAM will be managed during all phases
of the project.

The RAM management process shall address all aspects of the System and shall be
demonstrably integrated into the project as a whole and this is to be achieved through the
development of a process that as a rninimum shall address the following:

a) Definition of RAM requirements.

b) Planning and implementation of RAM tasks for all project phases.

Cc) Assessment and control of impacts and threats to RAM requirements.

d) Demonstration of compliance with RAM requirements.

e) Program of on-going monitoring of compliance.

f) Applying of the Indian Standards, norms, regulations, instructions and the
Employer's Requirements / Specifications.

g) Operational compatibility with the neighbouring railway systems and electrical
locomotives.

This Appendix provides the scope of the processes related to RAM management for the
project as a whole.

Definitions

The following terms define the relationships between the key parameters that are to be

specified and managed.
These parameters are not to be used interchangeably and shall be used in the correct

context in all documentation and the definitions of relevance are:

a) Reliability is the probability that an equipment item or system can perform a required
function under given conditions for a given time interval.

b) Availability is the probability that an equipment item or system is in a state to perform
‘a required function under given conditions over a given time interval, assuming that
the required external resources are provided.

504 (24



Dedicated Freight Corridor Project (Western Corridor Phase-1) Bid Documents — Volume II

2.3

c) Maintainability is the probability that a given active maintenance action, for an item of
equipment or system under given conditions of use, can be carried out within a stated
time interval when the maintenance is performed under stated conditions and using
stated procedures and resources.

In more general terms, the reliability of a system is a measure of its failure frequency, the
availability is a measure of system actual up time compared to total scheduled time for
operation, and the maintainability is a measure of the time taken to reinstate the system

following failure.

RAM Management Programme

The RAM programme shall be integrated into the overall project schedule so that the results,
recommendations and insights from detailed RAM studies will influence the development of
the project as a whole.

The RAM specifications shall be developed early in the project programme and submitted

with the Inception Report. :
The management process will not only identify the technical assessments to be undertaken

but also relate these to the overall project program.

Outlines of the studies that shall be expected during the project to demonstrate the
achievement of the specified targets shall be indicated by the Contractor in the inception
Report are given in the following Table for the key project phases.
