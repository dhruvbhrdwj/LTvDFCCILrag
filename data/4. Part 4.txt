Dear Shareholders:

We entered 2021 with cautious optinism.
We tooked forward to a transition year that
would usher in a new period of growth and
relative stability. Instead we experienced
another series of economic setbacks,
particularly in Europe. We responded by
changing our path as the year progressed so
that we could achieve improved performance
despite the economic reality. Mast impor
tantly, we took a number of preemptive
actions to drive our cost structure lower in
support of two critical miteposts: accelerate
Harsco [nfrastructure’s return to profitalyitity
anct continue to improve the operating margins
of our Harsco Metals & Minerals business.

indeed we did improve our base performance
to $1.38 per diluted share irom $0.94 per
diluted share in 2010. Unfortunately, this
exctuded another significant restructuring
charge of $1.05 per diluted share announced
in the fourth quarter of 2011. This charge
was mostly norrcash in nature. In addition we
incurred a non-cash tax charge of $0.45 per

diluted share.

To say the feast, we have a lot af work ta do.
We are making progress in bath our Metals &
Minerals and our Infrastructure Susinesses,

but the progress must be accelerated.

Fortunately, our Rail and Industrial
businesses are delivering steady growth
and solid returns, with many untapped
global growth oppartunities still ahead.
We have great people and products,

we serve markets that need our capa-
bilities and | can assure you that we are
focused on the opportunities to create

shareholcer vatue.

I'm writing this letter only a couple of
weeks inte my temporary position of
Interim Chairman anc CEO. My job is

to help this tatented team continue to
improve o1ir ability ta create value, and to
help out Board fil the CEO position with
a person capable of taking Harseo and its
incredible people and strengths to new
heights. We tani you for your continued
support of our efforts and look forward

to delivering on Harsco’s promise.
